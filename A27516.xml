            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Chriſtian Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN this unhappy Age of Contentions about <hi>Religion,</hi> wherein the heat of Controverſy hath ſo much cooled the fervour of true Devotion among us, that even ſome great Pretenders to Piety have only an outward form of Godlineſs without the inward Power; like guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sepulchers full of dead-mens Bones; it cannot but be very ſeaſonable, to teach all thoſe who believe in Jeſus, how to be real and <hi>Interiour Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in my Judgment, this Book written in <hi>French,</hi> and often Printed for its Excellency, has ſo well preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:57606:3"/> to the eye this Heavenly Leſſon, that I would not let ſo precious a Treaſure lie hid to the greateſt part of our Nation in an unknown Language, but have taken Pains to expoſe it to the publick view for a publick Good; and God give a Bleſſing to my Endeavours.</p>
            <p>If you ask me, What is it to be an <hi>Interiour Chriſtian?</hi> I'le briefly tell you, An <hi>Interiour Chriſtian</hi> is one, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well grounded in Faith, walks with God in ſimplicity of Heart, and Purity of Intention, loves him above all things, ſerves him Faithfully, endeavours to pleaſe him conſtantly, and had rather die than willfully by mortal Sin break friendſhip with him. There's no Devil he hates worſe than Hypocricy, his chiefeſt care being to be really in the ſight of God, what he appears to be in the eyes of Men, Yea, he is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly then he ſeems outwardly, as well conſidering, that God who ſees our hearts, will reward us accordingly.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:57606:3"/>
            <p> We may ſay of the <hi>Interiour Chriſtian</hi> what our Bleſſed Saviour ſaid of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanael, Ecce verè Iſraelita, in quo non eſt dolus, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi>

               <hi>void of Offence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and towards Men.</hi> And therefore may ſafely ſay with the ſame Saint elſe-where, <hi>Vivo ego, jam non ego, vivit verò in me Chriſtus, 'Tis not ſo mueh I that live, as</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>Chriſt who lives in me,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king me a new Creature by Internal Sanctification; whereby I become Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified to my Luſts, and dead to the World, that I may live to him who died for me.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:57606:4"/>
            <p> Now we muſt know that there are infinite degrees of Internal Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the leaſt degree is ſufficient to put us in Gods favour and the ſtate of Salvation, and make us really <hi>Interiour Chriſtians.</hi> As the leaſt <hi>Pigmy</hi> is as much eſſentially a man as the greateſt Gyant: This I mention, leaſt ſome ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and well-meaning Souls, who really endeavour to pleaſe God in ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Heart, reading in this Book, and other Spiritual Authors, more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and elevated wayes of advancing our union with God, then they experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in themſelves, (or perhaps ever ſhall in this Life,) ſhould he diſcourag'd and tortur'd with ſcruples, as if they did not ſerve God as they ought, and were not truly <hi>Interiour Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must put ſuch Souls in mind of what St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>That there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities of Gifts, but the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</note> 
               <hi>ſame Spirit, dividing to every man ſeverally as he will,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57606:4"/> 
               <hi>and pleaſes.</hi> Some indeed are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully elevated Saints, rapt with St. <hi>Paul</hi> into the third Heaven, raviſh'd in an extatical manner with the Glimmerings of Glory, and thoſe joyes which may be felt, but are inexpreſſible. Such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations and Unions with God, are rare and admirable.</p>
            <p>Others in their Re-collections and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Prayer receive from Heaven Divine Viſits, and wonderful Illuminations, which direct them how to purifie their Hearts more and more, and to advance in Piety and Godlineſs. Theſe are great Proficients, and walk in a region of Light above ordinary Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>But if Gods Holy Spirit has not vouchſaf'd us theſe ſpecial Gifts and Graces, we ought not to be diſcourag'd in our Pious Endeavours, but reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with our preſent ſtate in the courſe of our Devotions, if upon ſevere exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our Conſcience, we find that with <hi>Zakariah</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> we real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:57606:5"/> endeavour to walk in all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God blameleſs; and day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make it our work to conquer our ſelves to mortifie our Paſſions, to kill our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Deſires, and to make a progreſs in the wayes of Holineſs. This is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to entitle us to Heaven, and make us <hi>Interiour Chriſtians,</hi> though without raptures and extaſies, without viſions and unions extraordinary, without wonderful irradiations in mental Prayer, which God only vouchſafes to ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Favourites. Think upon this, and be content with what meaſure of Grace Heaven beſtows upon thee, walking with God in true Humility of Soul and Spirit.</p>
            <p>'Tis not much material, good Reader, in what order thou readeſt theſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Inſtructions; every Treatiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a Compleat Subject, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on each other. But my advice is, to make thoſe more familiar to thee, wherein thou findeſt moſt guſt and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb facs="tcp:57606:5"/> profit to thy Soul. This I am ſure of, whatever order thou obſerveſt, they will highly conduce to the end they were written; namely to withdraw our hearts from the Love of the World, and to advance our Union with God, by taking up our <hi>Croſs</hi> to follow Jeſus. This is the Spirit and Soul of this Book, and I heartily wiſh it may work theſe effects in every Reader. In the peruſal whereof Remember in thy Prayers.</p>

            <p>I Thought good, <hi>Courteous Reader,</hi> to explain ſome terms frequently occurring in this Treatiſe, to prevent miſtakes in ſuch who are not accuſtomed to ſuch expreſſions.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>Annihilation,</hi> is not to be taken Phyſically, but Morally. Now a <hi>Moral Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation</hi> is to acknowledge our ſelves, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Not able ſo much as to think a good thought, as of our ſelves,</hi> But that all our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency is of God, for whom is both the Will and the Work in Meritorious Actions. <hi>Gratia Deiſum id quod ſum.</hi> By Grace we are ſaved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our nothing, our ruine, ſelf-deſtruction Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Spirit,</hi> are terms which for the moſt part ſignifie the ſame thing as <hi>Annihilation.</hi> So that to ruine or deſtroy our ſelves, is to bring our ſelves to this <hi>Annihilation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Annihilation</hi> in ſome places ſignifies to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be thought of by others as of no worth, or good for nothing; an unworthy perſon, of reputation. And in this Senſe 'tis often applyed to our Bleſſed Saviour.</p>
            <p>But that the Reader may the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Spirit of the Book by the Spirit of the Author, I have deſcrib'd as much of the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of that Excellent Perſon, as I could col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect from the <hi>French Preface;</hi> the peruſal whereof I aſſure thee good <hi>Reader</hi> is worth thy pains and conſideration.</p>

            <head>THE <hi>Author's Life,</hi> Extracted out of the <hi>French</hi> PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE worthy Author of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Treatiſe, was a Perſon, whoſe Life was anſwerable to his Writings, a true <hi>Interiour Christian;</hi> elevated by God's Holy Spirit to Sublime Contemplation; making it his Buſineſs to have his Converſation in Heaven, while he was upon Earth. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that after he had Converſed fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly with God, and deſcended from the Mount, that his Face did ſhine with an extraordinary Glory. So this excellent Chriſtian came from his Prayers, as it were from Heaven, all enflamed with Divine Love, raiſing a holy Fire in their Breaſts, who enjoy'd the Happineſs of his Converſation.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:57606:7"/>
            <p> But his Goodneſs was more Diffuſive, for many of his abſent Friends received wonderful Benefit and Advancement in a Spiritual Life by his Heavenly Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Divine Letters. Which were ſo many, as that from thoſe Writings was extracted this <hi>Interiour Chriſtian,</hi> not long after he had left men to live with Angels, by a Perſon of Worth and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; who was ſo touched to the heart by reading ſome of his Letters, that he thought himſelf oblig'd in Charity, to make them Publick for the Common Good. Eſpecially in this Corrupt Age, wherein, alas! we find more <hi>Formal</hi> than <hi>Interiour</hi> Chriſtians. And doubtleſs it was the Will of Heaven this Treatiſe ſhould not lie hid, but be expos'd to the View of the World, having in a ſhort time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched the Hearts of many with ineſtim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Good, who entertain it with great Joy and Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>He was in the right who ſaid, <hi>Loquere ut te videam,</hi> If once I hear you ſpeak, I ſhall know what you are. For 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to read this Book without ſome Knowledge of the eminent Perfection of the Authour: for what Soul, unleſs irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diated with extraordinary Beams of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb facs="tcp:57606:7"/> Light, could make ſuch Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or give ſuch Directions in Spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity? It was from hence, that the Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Dolorous Bloody Sufferings of Jeſus Chriſt, (ſo terrible to Nature) did appear to him with a Raviſhing Beauty, being taken with nothing more in his Devotions, than Jeſus Suffering.</p>
            <p>For he had a ſingular Devotion to the Humiliations of Jeſus, and thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Perſon cull'd out by Providence to honour his Sufferings. He did much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to lead his Life in Abjections; and yet notwithſtanding his profound Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, he was much eſteemed, and admired by all who had the Happineſs to know his Virtues. Though he lookt upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as an unprofitable Servant; yet God was pleas'd to treat him as a faithful Friend. Though he deſir'd the Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Rigour of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> yet God did oftentimes ſo viſit his Soul with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Conſolations, that ſometimes he would cry out, <hi>When then, good Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, ſhall I ſuffer for you!</hi> Though he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to follow Jeſus on Mount <hi>Calva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> yet God was pleaſed to lead him to Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> and vouchſafe him the Glimmerings of Glory on this ſide Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
<pb facs="tcp:57606:8"/> Though too many make it their Buſineſs to find out wayes to pleaſe their Senſuality, he made his Body a Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Victime of Mortification, hardly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from Auſterities, when his Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs required a Relaxation.</p>
            <p>He earneſtly deſired, that after the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Jeſus he might finiſh his Life on the <hi>Croſs;</hi> and on the day the Church ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrates the <hi>Invention of the Croſs,</hi> God was pleaſed to rob the World ſecretly of ſo great a Treaſure, leſt if his Sickneſs had been known publickly, the holy Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of many Prayers might have prevailed with Heaven to defer his Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. He wanted no long Preparation for his Death by a Languiſhing Diſeaſe, but being Fruit-ripe for the Harveſt of Glory, by the conſtant Dews of Heaven and Fervour of Charity, upon ſhort warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with wonderful Content, commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Soul into the hands of his Saviour, he joyfully embraced Death to live Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naly.</p>
            <p>This ſhew'd the extraordinary Triumph he had made over the World, and Himſelf, by the Power of Grace. For though ſome, even Great Saints, who had left the World for Chriſt's ſake, to avoid it's
<pb facs="tcp:57606:8"/> Contagion, ſeem'd timorous at their Deaths, yet He, with an invincible Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, contemning the World, without for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking it, did conquer Satan in the midſt of Temptations, and ſmile on Death as a Friend to his Happineſs. Though he chang'd not his Secular Habit, yet he had fully baniſht the World from his heart, and without engaging in any other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, than that of a perfect Chriſtian, he ſpent his dayes in the Exerciſe of the moſt Auſtere Religious. And this was more admirable in him, than in thoſe Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, which conſerve their Sweetneſs in the midſt of Salt Waters: becauſe he did not only keep the Purity of the Spirit of Chriſtianity among the Infections of a Corrupt Age, but without any great noiſe he made notable Conqueſts over the Powers of Darkneſs, ſeeing by his Pious Endeavours he chang'd many Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Men into Spiritual Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>We may ſay without Vanity, that the World never had a more Dangerous Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. He ſtay'd in it, the better to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover its Deſigns, and convert World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: expoſing himſelf to combate its Allurements, that their Weakneſs might be known, and to teſtify to the World,
<pb facs="tcp:57606:9"/> that one may be a Perfect Chriſtian in deſpite of this great Enemy of God and Godlineſs. His Example hath made it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to all Perſons of Quality, that one may live like a Hermit in the midſt of a City, and may love Evangelical Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though not practiſe it in the Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Riches; and that true Self-contempt is not impoſſible to ſuch, whoſe Birth or Imployments have advanced them to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: and that without being an Apoſtle, or Preacher, one may be an Evangeliſt: And laſtly, that throughly to eſtabliſh the Maxims of Chriſtianity, ſolid Practice is more efficacious than thundring Eloquence.</p>
            <p>And though the Graces which beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed his Soul, did moſt incline him to deep Retirements and Contemplation, yet he was ſo wonderfully dexterous in the affairs of God's Service abroad, that his Eyes fix'd on Heaven, did not hinder him from affording a Helping hand to the good of his Neighbour; neither was his Zeal herein confin'd to one onely King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. His Piety was ſo ingenious, that he found out wayes to be at the ſame time one of the greateſt Solitaries, and yet much ingaged in the Labours of them, who endeavour'd the enlargement of Chriſts Kingdom.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:57606:9"/>
            <p> His way of expreſſing himſelf, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to his Thoughts, and both of them to the Goſpel; where ſuch who chiefly hunt after Eloquence, and vain Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, will find nothing that will pleaſe their Palate: But a Soul which reliſhes Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Truths, cannot but find a Guſt in the Expreſſions of this Book, which breaths forth nothing but the Spirit of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And God grant that they who take it into their hands, may find it working in their hearrs, to engage them efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in his Love and Service. So be it. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>Our happineſs conſiſts in a conſtant dependence on his divine will and pleaſure, with a perfect ſubmiſſion and reſignation thereunto. I muſt be content with my condition, whatever it be, ſeeing it is what God expects from me; and 'tis no ſmall
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57606:15"/> preſumption to aſſume to our ſelves what great Saints have found in the practice of Piety. God calls ſome perſons to glorious performances, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers he places in a lower rank; in all this we muſt ſuffer him to work his will upon us, and receive with thankfulneſs his Divine Impreſſions, whether great or little; 'tis enough for us that they come from God. This is the way God calls us to walk in; a way ſublime, pleaſant, full of peace, in which we deſire nothing but to pleaſe God. It concerns us to take whatever he gives with ſimplicity of heart; be it never ſo little, 'tis certainly more than we deſerve. To be annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in God, is to will nothing but what God wills, and in what manner he pleaſes; otherwiſe we ſeek our ſelves, and our own ſatisfaction, and not purely God, and his good pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>We muſt labour for Perfection with a Spirit wholly diſ-engaged from all ſelf-intereſt. To ſuffer, to live poor and deſpiſed, being the only way (among infinite other means) the Eternal Father made choice of, for us to attain to Glory, and regain thoſe Excellencies <hi>Adam</hi> loſt for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and us by ſin. This being his deſign from Eternity, his Son, in the fulneſs of time, embraced the Croſs with affection, and was inflamed with the deſire of ſuffering, valuing the Croſs as a thing of great excellency, being the Altar choſen for the life-giving Sacrifice by his heavenly Father: preferring the Glory and the Will of God before the natural inclinations of his Humanity, which had a repugnancy in the ſenſitive part thereof to pains and ſufferings.

                     <hi>Father, if it be poſſible, let this Cup paſs from me; yet not my will, but thine be fulfilled.</hi> And that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Sacrificium &amp; Oblationem noluiſti,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou would'st not have Sacrifice or Oblation, but thou haſt prepared a Body for me, and behold I come to do thy will.</hi> And ſo he did run his courſe with joy, though full of ſufferings, becauſe he knew it was the good pleaſure of his Father.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, by how much the more welove and eſteem the Croſs, by ſo much the more do we participate of the Spirit of Chriſt, and pleaſe his heavenly Father. For, to ſuffer, is to ſacrifice to God our pleaſures and intereſts, uniting our ſelves to the deſign that Jeſus had by ſuffering to repair his Father's Glory. O my Soul! if theſe Verities have made deep impreſſion in thee, thou ought'ſt from henceforth to glory in being deſpiſed, ſeeing thy Glory is to procure the Glory of God, which cannot be done more advantagiouſly, than by imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating his only Son.</p>
                  <p>O good Jeſus! poſſeſs my heart with your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit, that may enable me to live your life. O how your humiliations ſeem great unto me, your abjections honourable, your poverty rich, and your Croſs pleaſant! My Soul doth languiſh to poſſeſs your Spirit, and deſires it moſt ardently; whatever has not a reliſh of your Spirit, is not grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to me. O that I had inflamed affections to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Croſs, and that I could bear the greateſt can happen to me! In the <hi>interim</hi> it ſeems to me that I do nothing, and when occaſion preſents it ſelf, I find difficulty to ſuffer the leaſt afflictions. Dear Saviour, how is this life troubleſome unto me! Strengthen me forthwith to ſet upon the practice
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57606:16"/> of this life, hidden, crucified, deſpiſed, which you have taught us by your example; that I may truly ſay with St. <hi>Paul, Abſit mihi gloriari, niſi in cruce Domini nostri; Your Croſs, dear Jeſus, is my Glory, and I will glory in nothing elſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Honours, Pleaſures, Riches, I declare my mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal enemies, ſeeing your property is to incline me perpetually to deviate from thoſe ways to which Jeſus calls me: I abhor you, as enemies of my Perfection. Ah dear Saviour! make me partaker of your life, humble, poor, deſpiſed, or let me live no longer in this life of mortality. When Heaven ſhall be my Habitation, I ſhall be content to be in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, becauſe there you are alſo in Tryumph; but ſeeing that on Earth you would not be but in an abject condition, I deſire there to be with you alſo. Alas! I march but ſlowly to arrive at Perfection: however, in reality I would fain be wholly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled both interiourly and exteriourly, as your Divine wiſdom ſees beſt for me. If it was your will, I would ſearch after external humiliations, for I find no better food for a Chriſtian Soul. Perhaps they will prove hard of digeſtion to me; yet, for all that, they may become by uſe profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and delicious O dear Saviour! ſeeing it is ſaid of you by the Evangelical Prophet, <hi>Saturabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur opprobriis, Give me my fill of opprobies and abjections:</hi> Raviſh with your ſweetneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations thoſe who know well how to uſe ſuch favours; As for me, let my repaſt be with Gall and Vinegar, becauſe by their reliſh I ſhall be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred more like unto you.</p>
                  <p>O Jeſus! why was you circumciſed? O <hi>Mary!</hi> why was you purified? Your hearts were not ſulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57606:16"/> and yet you ſubmit your ſelves to the abjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſinners, becauſe to be deſpiſed was the object of your moſt tender affections. There were never two hearts more full of the love of God; and never more inflamed deſires after humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Seeing then that one is the meaſure of the other, if we will teſtifie that we love God, we muſt alſo love to ſuffer for him.</p>
                  <p>How unjuſt are our complaints againſt thoſe who undervalue us; and how unreaſonably are we diſquieted when we are ſcorn'd by others! We ought rather to be troubled becauſe we are not deſpiſed enough; and thus it would be with us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if we had a heart entirely Chriſtian. 'Tis true, Grace can only infuſe ſuch inclinations into our Souls, Nature eggs us on to the contrary. And 'tis my unhappineſs, that I who write this, ſhall (I fear) fall ſhort hereof in time of trial. For I am altogether frail, and good for nothing; and, for ought I know, what I have ſaid or done, which appears ſo beautiful, may be rotten with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; witneſs my often relapſes, which ſufficiently tell me what a poor abject Creature I am, and how much I deſerve to be deſpiſed.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57606:17"/> all Honour, all Glory, all Praiſe, all Adoration, is due unto him. O how juſt a debt is all this from us to the Divine Majeſty!</p>
                  <p>When I conſider, O God, that I am a pure Nothing, that I have in my ſelf an inexhauſtible Mine of imperfections and miſeries; that I have committed great offences, and am yet liable to more, unleſs prevented by Grace: I acknowledge that I deſerve to be the ſcorn of men; all ſorts of opprobries and diſgraces; all maladies of Soul and Body; Darkneſs, puniſhments Temporal and Eternal; to be afflicted, mocked, perſecuted by all creatures, as Executioners of Divine Juſtice: And I look upon my ſelf as the Mark, whereat ſhould be aimed theſe Arrows of deſerved indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>God can never be ſufficiently honoured, loved, exalted, glorified; and I can never be enough de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed, hated, deſpiſed and perſecuted. I ought to have not only this humility of Spirit, but likewiſe a will and affection to ſuffer for God; always e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming my ſelf worthy of all ſcorn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt though never ſo publick, if it may conduce to God's glory, and the good of others. For if I be honour'd as my condition requires, if I do not debaſe my ſelf below the meaneſt Vaſſals, 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Order of government forbids it, and would not be expedient for thoſe who might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe this condeſcenſion. However, as for me, I ought to have this will and inclination, and believe 'tis the place is due unto me.</p>
                  <p>Alas! dear Saviour, I cannot be acceptable in your ſight, unleſs I have an humble heart; and this I cannot have, but by your grace: For if all
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57606:17"/> natural good proceeds from your bounty, much more muſt all ſupernatural grace flow from the pure Fountain of your Mercy; and if you are the Giver of all grace, doubtleſs principally of true humility, which is ſo repugnant to nature, that there's nothing ſhe more abhors than Humiliation.</p>
                  <p>Seeing, dear Saviour, all good proceeds from you, the glory thereof ought ſolely to be rendred to you. I ought to take no complacence but in you, rejoycing in that you glorifie your ſelf, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching my poverty with your abundance.</p>
                  <p>When I ſee perſons afflicted, poor, diſtreſſed, lame, deformed, I confeſs (dear Saviour) theſe humiliations are my due; and if you ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict any of them on me, I would adore and love your Juſtice; and for what you have beſtowed upon me, I adore and love your mercy. I will never complain, becauſe no Creature can do me an injury. I ought not to look on the deſigns of men, whoſe intentions oftentimes are only to hurt, to revenge and ſolace themſelves with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers miſeries; but to have an eye to the purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God, which are to chaſtiſe me, to better me, and to humble me. The <hi>Jews</hi> put Jeſus Chriſt to death out of revenge and envy; and God the Father had a deſign thereby to ſave Mankind. I will not hereafter hunt after Applauſe and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, for I am reſolved not to follow the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of depraved Nature; but following the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Jeſus Chriſt, who ſuffered for me, I will deſire poverty, contempts, pains; and uniting them to his ſufferings, I will earneſtly beſeech him according to the multitude of his mercies to have pity on me.</p>

                  <p>OUr bleſſed Saviour gives me ſo clear a ſight of my own Nothing and Unworthineſs, that I am convinc'd this is the place of my abode, which I neither can, nor ought to abandon. When it pleaſes God to vouchſafe me no Heavenly influences in my Prayers and Recollections, I have no cauſe to complain; if the Dews of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven mollifie my heart, they only flow from his pure mercy. O how well-pleas'd am I with this view of my own weakneſs and unworthineſs! In this I acquieſce, as in my Centre.

Seeing I know it is God's pleaſure that I continue in my place, 'tis evident I cannot forſake it without diſpleaſing him. 'Tis my duty to abide fixed in my Nothing, by a free acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment that I can do nothing, and can merit nothing, for this is truth.

                  <p>God to bring man back into his place, and guide his feet into the way of truth, did leave his own, that is, the grandeur and ſplendor of his Majeſty, and came to us in weakneſs, in poverty, in annihilation, to ſhew us the way we ought to walk in, out of which all is but deceit and vanity. Man then muſt imitate the life of Jeſus in the ways of annihilation and abjections. O Jeſus! deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, perſecuted, crucified, do you vouchſafe to put your ſelf in my place? Alas! this only belongs to Me a wretched ſinner, and 'tis for You to live in Glory.</p>
                  <p>What is man become ſince the fall of <hi>Adam?</hi> A very Nothing, infirmity and frailty it ſelf. What

He muſt humble himſelf, annihilate himſelf, plunge himſelf into the Abyſs of his own Nothing, and live in perpetual fear of his own frailty.

                  <p>When I ſee God affords me no great occaſions to ſuffer contempt, or pains, or poverty, I ought to be humbled in my own eyes, becauſe this is a ſign I am but little in the ſight of God, who ſees here nothing of grandeur, which has not a great conformity with Chriſt crucified.

                  <p>COntempts and abjections are the deareſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of the Friends of God. Although ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriourly they may poſſeſs Riches, yet their heart is well advanced in the eſteem and love of Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. If they live in Honours, 'tis but in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, their hearts having an affection to be deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Nature indeed does not reliſh this kind of life, becauſe it fights continually againſt our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual inclinations. Human reaſon finds little or no guſt herein, ſeeking God only by her own light: but Grace elevates a Soul above ſenſe and reaſon, puſhing us on to ſupernatural actions. Jeſus Chriſt himſelf having reſolv'd to embrace the folly of the Croſs, did not do it but by a ſupernatural impulſe, as is manifeſt by his combat with the inferiour part of his Soul in the Garden; <hi>Father, if it be poſſible, let this Cup paſs from me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe who ſeem to us moſt wonderful Saints, are ſuch who have been ſuper-eminent in ſelf-contempt and abnegation. Who does not admire the generous Spirit of holy <hi>Paula,</hi> that <hi>Roman</hi> Lady, who being enamour'd on the poverty and humiliations of Jeſus, forſook <hi>Rome</hi> and all her Relations, to embrace a poor and abject life? She that could have done very much for others with her Riches in that capital City, did prefer
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57606:20"/> the Stable at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> before ſumptuous Palaces. <hi>Elegi abjectus eſſe in domo Dei.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexius</hi> might have done God good ſervice in a marriage life; yet he was ſo raviſh'd with the beauty of a life hidden and deſpicaple, that he forſook Father, Mother, Wife, Friends, Poſſeſſions, Honours, which may be kept with a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: but having a Divine call to the eminency of an abject life, by a wonderful miracle of grace, he, amidſt his dear Relations, would not ſuffer natural (though lawful) affection to take a lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his heart; he afflicts himſelf with hunger, in a Houſe which belong'd to him; he becomes the ſcorn and ſport of thoſe Servants, to whom he was Maſter; his heart continued conſtant and faithful, to deſire nothing but abjections, and no batteries of human reaſon could conquer or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his reſolutions. O how this way is elevated above the low deſigns of our nature, which is too much enamour'd on flattering vanities!</p>
                  <p>Many fly from abjections and ſufferings, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to glorifie God in a more noble manner, by actions more glorious and profitable to others: but this is rather to follow our own inclination, than the example of Jeſus Chriſt. For we ought to ſerve him after his model, and not according to our fancy: and we ſee his life was a life of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and humiliations.</p>
                  <p>'Tis wonderful to conſider the elevated Soul of St. <hi>Armogaſtus,</hi> a Count and great Seigneur, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the King (a Perſecuter of Religion) to keep Beaſts all his life, and die by miſeries and poverty in this employment. 'Tis wonderful to conſider what a Kingdom and Sovereignty abje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57606:20"/> had erected in the heart of this great Saint, manifeſting it ſelf daily by ſupernatural actions. For he loved nothing more dearly than to ſee himſelf buried in deep Oblivion, and to be deſpiſed by all Creatures; and the miſeries he ſuffered in this low condition, were the delights of his Soul. Whilſt other Nobles, his Countrey-men and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries, liv'd glorious with their Tryumphs in the Courts of Emperours, <hi>Armogaſtus</hi> liv'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Beaſts, as if good for nothing, he deſerv'd not the company of men.</p>
                  <p>O <hi>Armogaſtus!</hi> where is the generous ſpirit of a Cavalier? where is the courage of a Gentle-man? why do you not quit this employment, at leaſt that you may ſhine bright in the grand exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of Chriſtianity?

                  <head>CHAP. V. <hi>That we have only ſo much of the true Spirit of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>as we have an inclination to abjection.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IF the purity of love be on Earth, it is in the heart of thoſe who love abjection, ſeeing they deſire nothing but the intereſt of God, his glory purely, being in a manner wholly abſorpt in ſelf-oblivion. To behold God advancing others to ſtates ſublime and glorious, that they are but as atoms in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, and to reſt content in their abjections, is a matter of greateſt difficulty, becauſe herein they quit even their own ſpiritual intereſts, being ſatisfied with whatever God does for them, and with that meaſure of glory he will have us bring unto him, though never ſo little. 'Tis true, that this ſort of abjection was not in Jeſus Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being God, the fulneſs of all grandeurs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto him. But this is altogether proper to us, becauſe we are Creatures, poor and abject; and that little God gives us, is more than we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, ſeeing we of our ſelves can merit nothing.</p>
                  <p>'Tis to be feared there are but few who follow Jeſus Chriſt in the practice of that abjection he loved for our ſakes. In our thoughts and words we may do it; but when any occaſion of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation or ſuffering happens, we make the braveſt pretenſions poſſible to be freed from it. Even ſuch who make a profeſſion of Devotion, will ſuffer the want of nothing, nor any injury from others;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57606:21"/> they are for governing affairs as they pleaſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſubjection or dependance; ſhunning ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, becauſe they think they can more glorifie God by Grandeur and Reputation in the world. This is a meer illuſion of ſelf-love, and a vanity of nature, which in every thing affects to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, and not to be humbled.</p>
                  <p>Not with ſtanding, let us think and ſay what we pleaſe, what meaſure we have of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, is according to the degree of true mortification and ſelf-denyal we find in us. He expects we ſhould honour his voluntary humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the ſacrifice of our pride. Now, in a Sacrifice the Hoſt immolated is deſtroy'd, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of its former being; ſo that we muſt make a continual Sacrifice of our reaſon and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, of our will and inclinations, to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and commands of others: of our reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by a love to abjection: of our goods, by poverty: of our health and corporal ſatisfactions, by pains and auſterities: In a word, we muſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice all our natural inclinations to the honour of God, being as well content with adverſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents as proſperous ſucceſſes; becauſe the good uſe of humiliations is better for us than proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>It is an excellent Leſſon we learn by the love of abjection, but 'tis very hard to take out, and without a continual looking over is ſoon forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. The virtues which conſiſt in action, are more eaſily practiſed, leſs troubleſom to us, and more ſatisfactory to others: But thoſe that conſiſt pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſuffering, as Humiliation, Patience, Abne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, are very difficult. O Jeſus! abject and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57606:22"/> humble, infuſe into my Soul the Science of Saints, and a reliſh of contempt of the world, and I ſhall learn perfectly the Leſſon of true humility, which is above the apprehenſion of human reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Our bleſſed Saviour ſometimes puts us upon the undertaking of certain good deſigns, whereof he wills not the <hi>Execution,</hi> but the <hi>Practice</hi> of many Virtues, which ariſe in their purſuance and fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the deſired iſſue. Nature is much diſturb'd at ill ſucceſſes, but God, by the wonderful contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of his wiſdom, oftentimes more glorifies himſelf by adverſe than favourable events. For the diſpoſitions of humiliation, reſignation, and contentedneſs, which he ſees in a Soul, are more pleaſing than what ſhe deſigned.</p>
                  <p>St: <hi>Lewis</hi> earneſtly deſired to re-eſtabliſh the glory of God in <hi>Paleſtine:</hi> all fell out contrary to his good deſigns; but the purpoſes which God had to advance his glory, took good effect. For this great King was humbled and made abject in the eyes of the world, falling into the hands of his Enemies, his Army being deſtroyed either by the Sword or Peſtilence. O how theſe grand hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations (in the midſt of which the invincible Soul of this holy King reſted more content than in a Trpumph) did render a marvelous homage to the Son of God, in the ſelf-ſame place where he ſuffered for us! Perhaps this glory was greater in his ſight, than if the Sword of St. <hi>Lewis</hi> had ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed all the Infidels in <hi>Paleſtine.</hi>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57606:22"/> humiliation, and ſelf-denial. When we cannot do the good we would, 'tis no ſmall good to acknowledge our inſufficiency and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs. When we are hindred from our uſual recollection, by ſome incommodity, we may hope that one good hour of ſuffering and abjection with a contented mind, will prove better to us than an hour of Prayer, wherein, perhaps, we ſhould take more ſelf-ſatisfaction. When we think the Soul is not in fit temper to converſe with God, becauſe we are diſturb'd with many importunities, let us remember that this may proceed from Nature; but the repoſe of grace is that which is only neceſſary for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection. Now, the repoſe of grace finds her ſelf better in croſſes, and pains, and abjections, than otherwiſe. <hi>In tribulatione dilataſti mihi; My heart was enlarged towards God in tribulation.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>That the ſight of our own Nothing, inſpires us with ſelf-contempt, and the love of God.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe principal reaſon of our little or no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, is becauſe we do not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depend upon grace; we are not ſo frequent as we ought in our recourſe to God; we too much rely on the Creatures, that is, on the means we uſe, for our proficiency; as, the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of good Books, Conferences, Sermons, Meditation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All theſe are very good, when they are done with great confidence in God,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57606:23"/> and fervent Prayer; for nothing but an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty hand can pluck us out of the depth of our Miſeries, and crown us with Glory.</p>
                  <p>God is an infinite good, in whom all fulneſs dwells; and whatever good is in the Creature, are but emenations from Him: the Creature of it ſelf being but a meer <hi>Vacuum,</hi> and privation of goodneſs. As we cannot conceive a greater fulneſs than is in God, ſo we cannot imagine a more extreme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>indigency than is in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. 'Tis the ſame thing to be God and all Goodneſs, and to be a Creature and Nothing: the One is all Abundance, the Other all Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Every one grants this truth, but without ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reflection; which is the cauſe we have no true ſelf-denial, and diffidence in our own abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities: and as much as we rely on our ſelves, we hinder the operation of grace in us. O my God! I am content with my Poverty, becauſe it brings me to the knowledge of your Riches; I ſhould forget what I am, if I were not full of wants and imperfections. I am well pleaſed that you are All, and I am Nothing, but what you vouchſafe to beſtow on me.</p>
                  <p>The three Divine Perſons can only propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally communicate to each other their infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Perfections. I, poor Creature, can give nothing to God, nor do any thing for him. The beſt I can do, is to acknowledge my inability and weakneſs; neither can I do this, without his grace, which alſo he gives unto me.</p>
                  <p>There is ſo infinite a diſproportion between God and a Creature, that if I ſhould lay down my life for God's ſake, it would be leſs than if
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57606:23"/> a Piſmire ſhould die for the greateſt Monarch. Whatever the glorious Angels or Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or his Servants on Earth, can do for God, adds nothing to him. We cannot dive into the full depth of our Nothing, God only knows it; and what we diſcover by it, is by the illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Rays of his Grace and Mercy.</p>
                  <p>To underſtand this well, we muſt know, that God is not glorified by our good actions, but inaſmuch as they are agreeable to his will, from whence they receive the tincture of goodneſs; and he magnifies his bounty and mercy, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting and rewarding our ſmall performances. So that the graces and favours he beſtows upon us in this life, and the glory of the other, are the effects of his pure goodneſs.</p>
                  <p>'Tis very advantagious for a Soul thus to know her own Nothing, for it makes her a Martyr of Love, and loving God will do any thing for him; and by this knowledge, ſees that of her ſelf ſhe can do nothing. So that, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were between will and weakneſs, ſhe breaths forth ſuch deſires as did St. <hi>Auſtin; If I was God, and you a Creature; I would willingly become a Creature, that you might be God.</hi> But perceiving this to be an impoſſible imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this poor Soul increaſes her Martyrdom, and dies of love, becauſe not able to do any thing for her Beloved. Yet this one conſolation does revive her, in that though ſhe can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, her well-beloved can do all, and taking delight in what he is, and that he hath no need of any thing, ſhe repoſes quietly in the boſom of God, who is her all, and final happineſs.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>That God is glorified by our annihilation.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>NOthing but Divine Faith can teach us to love mortification, and the annihilation of our ſelves. Natural and worldly wiſdom can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reliſh it, and therefore are not to be conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or hearkened to, being but blind guides in the practice thereof.</p>
                  <p>The ſin of pride has ruin'd the Glory and Kingdom of God in our Souls, and that cannot be re-eſtabliſhed, but by our ruine: and by how much the more we are mortified and dead to our ſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by ſo much the more God is revived in us. Poor Creatures as we are, we afflict our ſelves becauſe we are ſo weak, and good for nothing, without talents, without knowledge, that left to our ſelves, all things go wrong with us. O that we would learn to be content with theſe miſeries, that we might thereby arrive to the happy ſtate of annihilation, we might then bring as much glory to God, as by great performances; for in all theſe privations the Soul finds no relyance or conſolation in her ſelf, or in any other Creature, but in God alone.</p>
                  <p>Holy <hi>Job</hi> never brought more glory to God, than when he was plung'd in the Abyſs of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations, on a Dunghil. God glorifies himſelf in Heaven, by the exaltation of his Creatures; here on Earth, by their humiliation. Do we not ſee that the Wiſdom of the eternal Father did
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57606:24"/> preſcribe to his Son this way of honouring him on Earth? Hath not our bleſſed Saviour taught us by his words and actions in the conſtant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of ſelf-denial? And think we to find out a better way to glorifie God, than what our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Maſter hath ſet before us?</p>
                  <p>There's nothing wherein a Creature can more purely glorifie the Creator, than by a willing ſubmiſſion to that ſelf-deſtruction, which God works in us; for where there is the leaſt of the Creature, there's moſt of God. But in this God does in a manner work all, and the Creature yields obedience to his operations. To bear patiently the deprivation of light, and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſenſible influences in Heaven in our recollections, may do us more good than the moſt illuminated and guſtful Prayer. To be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd and forſaken by our Friends, and bear it with patience and reſignation, may more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit us than their friendſhip and ſervices. And ſo it is in the loſs of other things, becauſe in dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lictions and deprivations we ſeek God with a more purified intention; there being leſs of ſelf in it, having not the ſatisfaction to act, but only to receive the loſs of what is dear to us, meerly becauſe it pleaſes God thus to deal with us for his greater glory.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a ſad thing to conſider the blindneſs wherein I have lived. O how hard a thing it is for human reaſon to apprehend the Doctrine of the Son of God! 'Tis true, it teaches us to crucifie and deny our ſelves, which is what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally we fear and dread. The meaſure of God's love to a Soul is to be judged by its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57606:25"/> of humiliation; which is a way without all exception, ſeeing the Goſpel tells us, that <hi>whoſoever does not deny himſelf and all worldly things, cannot be the Diſciple of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> O dear Jeſus, humbled for us! I ſee the way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you have walked, and that I muſt take up my Croſs to follow you; I am content to accept it, and am willing to be your Diſciple.</p>
                  <p>Be it then that my Body be afflicted with ſickneſs, my Goods loſt, my Honour in the duſt, and I become, as I deſerve, of little or no eſteem and repute: Be it that you withdraw from me your Divine Illuminations in Prayer and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection, ſo as to be in a manner void of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, <hi>ſicut equus &amp; malus, quibus non eſt intellectus:</hi> Provided, dear Jeſus, that I be but content with theſe humiliations, it is ſufficient; I ſhall be happy. Let others ask of you what they pleaſe; as for me, my deſire is to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely annihilated, and that my portion may be to honour your Divine humiliations.</p>
                  <p>We are not couragious enough to fight as we ought, to deſtroy in us our ſenſual inclinations, for we are too feeble againſt our ſelves, and too indulgent to our defects in this ſpiritual combat.

                  <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>That the Soul is Rich, when ſhe poſſeſses the love of ſelf-contempt.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>GOD has infus'd this thought into my Soul, that the love of ſelf-contempt, and the deſire of humiliation, may be that hidden Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure mention'd in the Goſpel, <hi>Theſauro abſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dita in agro,</hi> Matt. 13.</p>
                  <p>'Tis really a great Treaſure to love abjection; yea, a Treaſure that contains abundance of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable Riches: but they appear not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, being hid on purpoſe to preſerve with more ſecurity; And he only has this Treaſure, who keeps well hidden what he poſſeſſes.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a Treaſure hidden and unknown to the world; For who would imagine that there ſhould be any thing ſo rich and precious in Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and Humiliations? Should our ſenſes, or carnal prudence, or human reaſon, make en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, would they ſearch <hi>here</hi> to enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſatisfie their deſires? We could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have thought that a hidden Treaſure was here enſhrin'd, if Jeſus Chriſt, who put it there himſelf, had not reveal'd this great ſecret to our Souls, by his peculiar favour, and merciful il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminations.</p>
                  <p>If we will have this Treaſure, we muſt buy it, and give for it whatever we poſſeſs: that is to ſay, we muſt lay down our whole Patrimony, the fatal Inheritance left us by our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57606:26"/> namely, affection for Honours, for Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, for Riches; too much ſeeking our ſelves, and our own intereſts, the love of our own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, and all the other wretched movables, which we poſſeſs by being conceived in ſin, and brought forth in iniquity. If we will not be content to part with all, yea the utmoſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, we cannot be enriched with this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                  <p>O how rich and happy is he who does poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs it! For it is a Treaſure, which, as the world cannog give, ſo it cannot take it from us; and as long as we are in quiet poſſeſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we find God in our Souls, and ſuch a profound peace, as paſſeth all human underſtanding. When one has purchas'd a good Eſtate in Land, we are ready to ſay, He is in a good condition; what need he fear now, having a ſure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſubſiſtence? If a War happen, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies can't carry that away with them: they may indeed deprive him of his Money and Goods; but for his Land, that is fix'd and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable.</p>
                  <p>'Tis the ſame caſe with this precious Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; when once the Soul hath it in poſſeſſion, and will not part with it, ſhe need not fear, ſhe has ſure hold of ſubſiſtence for her ſpiritual life. Neither the World, nor the Devil, nor all the Enemies of our Salvation, let them make never ſuch furious on-ſets, can rob her of it; it ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes their power, and belongs not to them. 'Tis true, they may deprive her of ſome move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, as ſenſible conſolations, the love of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities, the deſire to undertake brave actions
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57606:26"/> for the Glory of God, as to go to <hi>Canada</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> for the converſion of Souls to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith;</hi> in a word, all the fair Idaea's of Spirituality. The Devil, the World, Nature, has a mind to theſe movables; and a Soul that poſſeſſes only <hi>theſe,</hi> has nothing but what may be taken from her: but whoſoever poſſeſſes this Treaſure of the love of abjection and ſelf-denial, is rich for ever. And when God is pleaſed to diſcover to a Soul the value thereof; <hi>Prae gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio illius vadit, &amp; vendit univerſa quae habet, &amp; emit agrum illum;</hi> ſhe joyfully parts with all ſhe has, to get it in poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>We have a double right to pretend to the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of this Divine Treaſure. The firſt is, our natural inability to good: the ſecond is, our criminal ſinfulneſs. Theſe two lay upon us a continual obligation to endeavour after ſelf-denial and annihilation; and this endeavour is very pleaſing to God, who delights to ſee a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture acknowledge what is due to it ſelf, and render to him his deſerved Glory. The Son of God began as a Gyant to run in this way of ſelf-contempt, by his Incarnation; for 'tis a wonderful humiliation for God to become Man: and he finiſhed this courſe by his Death on the Croſs, which was as low as humility could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend. For God-Man to die an infamous death, between two Thieves, as a Malefactor, and his whole life beſides was but as one continued hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation: and yet (alas!) we paſs away our days in vanity, calling our ſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> tho' all for exaltation of our ſelves, deſtitute of ſelf-denial and true humility. O wonderful blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs!</p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:57606:27"/>
                  <p> O Jeſus, poor and abject! when will you draw me after you by the powerful attracts of your mercy? Your ways are pure, and pleaſant, and odoriferous to thoſe whoſe Souls are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened with the Rays of Grace. You, (O Jeſus!) eſtabliſh your Empire in humble hearts, and reign there in peace; as the Devil ſets up his Kingdom in proud Souls, and there domineers with intolerable Tyranny.</p>

                  <p>PAins and Miſeries humble the body; Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Riches, Contempt, Reputation and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Death, Life, aridities in Prayer, ſpiritual Conſolations; all theſe conduce to purifie Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and ſacrifice man wholly to God. Some glorifie him by action, ſome by ſuffering, others by privations and humiliations: and theſe laſt are the greateſt Saints, though here deſpis'd, and known to God alone. We ought to reſign our ſelves to the conduct of God's ſpirit; but if it was left to our own choice, the way of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections is beſt and ſafeſt. <hi>Job</hi> did more glorifie God on the Dunghil, than in his Palace. Happy is he, who in glorifying God, follows the call of his holy inſpirations, in a way which the world neither does nor can well underſtand.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a great miſery not to be willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that human wiſdom is but folly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, which continually eggs us on to get
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57606:27"/> out of the happy ſtate of abjection, upon the faireſt pretences imaginable, as the ſalvation of ſouls, to help our Neighbours, and the like. Notwithſtanding 'tis ſafeſt to yield our ſelves up to the ſole conduct of God's holy Spirit, the order of whoſe providence we cannot ſhun. God glorifies himſelf in Heaven, by the exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Creatures, on Earth by their Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Let no perſon complain then, that he cannot be inſtrumental to the glory of God; for let him but heap up his own miſeries, and lay himſelf thereon, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was on the Altar, and then ſacrifice himſelf by a voluntary anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation, with the fire of Divine Love, and God will be glorified thereby.</p>
                  <p>When a Soul is left to her ſelf in Prayer, ſo that aridities and deſolations do darken her wonted light, and deprive her of the uſual fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings ſhe had of God and Goodneſs, ſhe may make her addreſs in theſe or ſuch-like words; <hi>My God! I am nothing, and I am contented with all my heart with this dealing with me; it is your pleaſure thus to mortifie me, and I have no other will but yours.

                  <p>St. <hi>Lewis</hi> had hopes to eſtabliſh the glory of Jeſus Chriſt in <hi>Palestine;</hi> but ſeeing his Army defeated, he might comfort himſelf, in ſaying, <hi>O my God! ſeeing 'tis not your pleaſure to have it ſo, but have humbled me and my Army by the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence and Sword of your Enemies, your will be done, I ſubmit unto it. I behold the generous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes of your Servants, and their great At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, and bleſs you for them: but my comfort is in the conſideration of my objections, which have brought me to a ſtate wherein I ſee God alone, and poſſeſs Him in the denudation of all Creatures, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the example of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> Chriſtus non ſibi placuit; <hi>whoſe work was only to do your will.</hi>

                  <p>I Conceive three deprivations neceſſary to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this. Firſt, the deprivation of all exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour things; as, Riches, Honours, Pleaſures. This is the firſt advance a Soul muſt make to draw near to God: for as long as there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains the leaſt inordinate affection to theſe things, ſhe can never make any great progreſs in finding God, being fetter'd as it were by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affections, and ſo cannot have perfect poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of God, being excluded by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which more or leſs take up the heart.</p>
                  <p>When neceſſity or charity require it, we may have the real poſſeſſion of theſe things, and live only in diſpoſition of ſpirit, and affective po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty. However, it will be matter of joy to be freed from them, becauſe for the moſt part they rather hinder than advance us towards union with God. And if we have not a great care, Nature will cheat us with a pretext of Charity, and helping others; which is but a good illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57606:29"/> for ſometimes they who have the leſs Riches, have the more charitable hearts.</p>
                  <p>'Tis good counſel to forſake Riches and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, when it may be done conveniently; but when, by ſecret tracts of Divine Providence, they forſake us, 'tis our duty to poſſeſs our Souls in patience, and be contented; which is in a manner better than if we our ſelves had left them; eſpecially when we believe theſe loſſes happen'd by our own fault and imbecility; for this brings us to a greater abjection and ſelf-contempt, which is the centre whither we ought to tend.</p>
                  <p>If there was nothing elſe good in poverty but this, that it mortifies our liberty and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, whereof naturally we are ſo amorous, 'tis a great happineſs to be enrich'd therewith. When we are out of Employment and Honour in the world, we are look'd upon as unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and eaſily forgotten and forſaken by our beſt Friends; 'tis ſo much the better for our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation.</p>
                  <p>This is the ſecond deprivation that we muſt ſuffer. O the great Grace that is neceſſary to carry on a Soul to God, when we are deſpiſed by our Friends, whereby they become rather the ſubject of affliction than affection to us. Without doubt we have a ſtrong inclination to them, to whom we are ſo glew'd, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome great and ſpecial grace we can never mortifie our ſelves therein, without ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach to conſerve ſuch friendſhip. They are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py occaſions, whereby we are depriv'd of our Friends without ſin; in loſing them, we loſe a great upholder of ſelf-love in us.</p>

Great Saint! they are Saints whom you forſake. <hi>I know that very well</hi> (ſays he) <hi>but they are my Relations that have an affection for me.</hi> O what a violence is this to nature! For when an attach to Friends, (eſpecially if virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) ſeems more ſpiritual and reaſonable than any other affection, to mortifie our ſelves in this, is an extraordinary Sacrifice to God, and only granted to ſuch Souls whom he carries on to great perfection. But we muſt paſs further yet:</p>
                  <p>For there's a third deprivation to loſe our ſelves; which is, to be eſteem'd as Fools for Chriſt's ſake, according to that of St. <hi>Paul, Nos ſtulti propter Chriſtum.</hi> To love, to obey, and be in ſubjection; to have no reaſon, and yet to renounce our own reaſon, and to enthrone Faith in our Souls for direction. O how the pure light of Faith diſcovers to us, that we ought to be well pleaſed to have no great natural parts, but to be (as it were) good for nothing! For the view thereof, if it come to the heart, does po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfully annihilate the natural inclination we have to be eſteemed. To conſent willingly to be abject and deſpiſed, is a great means to empty us of this ſelf-love; and according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of this evacuation, is the degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                  <p>O my God! how hard a thing is it for us not to ſeek our ſelves, and not at all to pretend to eſteem and excellence! The deſire we have thereof, is as intime to us as the marrow of our
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57606:30"/> bones; and in a manner in all our actions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for our ſelves or our Neighbours, we ſeek more or leſs our own excellence. The greateſt Saints have had little eſteem of their own Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents in their own eyes, when they have been obliged to make them glorious in the ſight of others. And unleſs they did cauſe them to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for the good of others, they did tend to humiliation, plunging themſelves in their own Nothing, to bring down thereby all Pride of heart.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>IF we put our ſelves into the hands of Jeſus Chriſt, he will treat us as his Father treated him; for Divine Love has ſeverity as well as Divine Juſtice. Happy is that Soul, which (all on fire with Divine Love) is not content nor ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, till ſhe has ſo wholly ſacrifie'd her ſelf to God, that the love of the Creature is burn'd to nothing This Love is a Sun full of fire and light, which by little and little draws up the vapours from the Earth, (that is, the Creatures) and drinks them up.</p>
                  <p>I have a buſineſs in hand, which puts me to hard labour; namely, to mortifie my ſelf in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and affection to all Creatures; if I can bring it about, I ſhall be happy. All that I have done hitherto, is but a preparation to take up my
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57606:30"/> Croſs, and entirely to follow Chriſt in his humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations. I ſee him born in a poor abject manner in the eyes of men, and thus, like a Gyant, he begins the courſe of his abjections. Why do we delay to follow him by annihilation, poverty, and ſelf-contempt? Let's never leave him, whatſoever we ſuffer. For my part, I have made a ſolemn proteſtation, that I will follow him ſo cloſe by being crucified to the world, that every moment of my life I ſhall be able to ſay, <hi>'Tis not I that live, but Jeſus crucified who lives in me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us not wonder at the proceedings of Jeſus Chriſt, who preaches to us nothing but death and annihilation, the Croſs and abnegation. 'Tis becauſe our Soul, infected with ſin, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are conceived, is ſo ſtrongly corrupted, that all her operations are impure. Jeſus Chriſt is come by his grace to cleanſe this impurity, which is ſo deeply fixed and in grain, that except we reſolutely correſpond to the workings of grace in us, we ſhall ſtill remain in our imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; which grace tends to bring us to ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contempt and annihilation.</p>
                  <p>Having this day received my Saviour in the bleſſed Sacrament, I kept my ſelf as it were wholly annihilated while he continued in me; and permitted him to in me and for me what he pleaſed, both in relation to his Father, and my poor Soul, and thoſe perſons for whom I had interceded in the dreadful Sacrifice. It ſeems to me I ought not to mingle the operations of an impure Creature with thoſe of Jeſus. O that Jeſus would alone work in me what is my duty! I ought to plunge my ſelf in my own Nothing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57606:31"/> in his preſence. If I muſt love God, Jeſus will work this in me; if I muſt pray, Jeſus will be my Advocate; if I muſt glorifie his Father, he will glorifie him, and I will ſweetly conſent to all his operations. O Jeſus! be you All, that I may be Nothing; work your will in me, I will remain in my Nothing, to let you work all in me without reſiſtance. Many good Souls honour the abjections of Jeſus Chriſt, but few will practice them, or imitate his poverty and humiliations. Shall we think that it did not beſeem you to be ſo debaſed, and thus to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer? O Jeſus! is not this to make no account of your example, and condemn you of Folly, who are the Wiſdom of the Father? 'Tis a great folly to be thus cenſorious; and certainly, the more we participate of your poverty and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations, the more we participate of your wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Come then, O my Soul, let us follow Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus poor and abject, and live poor with him, and thereby teſtifie our love to him, and our fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THe impediments that our ſenſitive part brings to perfection are eaſie to be diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but the interpoſitions of human reaſon are nice and delicate, and few diſcover them. They are hard to conquer, and many cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57606:31"/> of their badneſs; for reaſon is ingenious to ſeduce by a thouſand fair pretences, which we dare hardly condemn, appearing ſo reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; but the example of Jeſus Chriſt is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all reaſon and human prudence.</p>
                  <p>What reaſon was there that the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours ſhould live in tryumphs; that cruel <hi>Herods</hi> ſhould ſhine with Honours, and melt in Pleaſures; that the hard-hearted <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould enjoy all worldly contents and abundance: and in the <hi>interim,</hi> the Son of God ſhould be born in a Stable, ſhould fly by night into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> live a poor life in a ſhop with a Carpenter, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelm'd with pains and diſgraces? How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, theſe are the proceedings of the eternal Father, to confound thereby our human pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and teach us to renounce our ſelves, if we will be good followers of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>As long as we give more ear to the perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of human reaſon, than to the light of Faith, we ſhall never make any great progreſs in Piety. If one be in a poor and abject con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, human prudence is for Advancement and Riches, when any occaſion preſents it ſelf. If one be born to Honours and Poſſeſſions, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſays, <hi>Leave them not, to become poor and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</hi> How can we draw our ſelves out of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to imitate Divine Jeſus, if we will always follow the Maxims of men?</p>
                  <p>We are very buſie to live in the world accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our condition; but we do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſufficiently, that our chiefeſt care ought to be to live the life of Jeſus Chriſt, and let all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obligations give place unto it. Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57606:32"/> executing the eternal purpoſes of his Father, in a poor, deſpiſed painful life, did infinitely glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him thereby. Before the Incarnation, God was not infinitely lov'd and glorified <hi>out of himſelf,</hi> but only <hi>in himſelf;</hi> inaſmuch as the humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of one that is God, brings an infinite glory to God, which before he had not. A Chriſtian Soul likewiſe executing the divine Will of the eternal Father, by following his Son in a life of humiliations and ſelf-contempt, does glorifie him with ſovereign Honour: For 'twas decreed from all Eternity, that the Members ſhould live the life of the Head; <hi>Quos praedeſtinavit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes fieri;</hi> and firſt ſuffer with him, that they may at laſt with him be glorified. All human reaſon muſt yield to this divine determination. O Jeſus! how ſtrange are the foundations of that perfection to which you call us! They are nothing but Deaths, Renunciations, Poverties, Abandonments, and Croſſes; ſo that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is <hi>agreeable to Nature,</hi> ſeems wholly <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Grace.</hi> Why do you not, dear Saviour, bring man to his Nothing in a moment by your Omnipotency, to make him thereby a new Creature? Why will you that he muſt annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late himſelf and contribute to his own deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. O how the methods of your Wiſdom are admirable! Your deſign is hereby to bring man to love you. But he can never do this more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly, than by the ſtrongeſt efforts of ſelf-contempt and annihilation. Human reaſon prompts us to ſelf-love and ſelf-eſteem: Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine reaſon inſpires us with ſelf-contempt and abnegation. <hi>Abraham</hi> ſacrificing his Son, did
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57606:32"/> fooliſhly in the judgment of human reaſon, as being an enemy to Himſelf, and his whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: but this was an action of wonderful pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the judgment of Divine reaſon; ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby that he loved God more than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his deareſt Relations. Come then, O my Soul, let us ſtrive to be dead to all things but God, and to annihilate our ſelves for his ſake I ſee an unſpeakable beauty in the horror of mortifications and ſufferings, ſeeing they are the ſource from whence purity flows into the Soul.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>I Know now better than ever, that abjection is the way wherein we muſt march, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance aſſuredly to the perfection we aim at: all other ways are liable to deceit, but ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial is without deluſion. O how few do conſider the proceedings of Jeſus Chriſt! and fewer dive into and comprehend his holy diſpoſitions! But feweſt ſet upon a perfect imitation of what they know.</p>
                  <p>Let us fall to work, we know enough of it. We are not ignorant how Jeſus humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Womb of his Virgin-Mother, and there remained nine months, and at his Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty did increaſe his humiliation, by being born in a Stable; continued them all his life-time,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57606:33"/> and finiſhed them by his Death upon the Croſs, the grand Theatre of his humiliations. We know all this; it only remains to imitate him; Grace will conduct us, if we faithfully correſpond to God's Inſpirations. To this end God permits that our Friends fall off from us, that ſome little diſgraces happen, that we are ſomewhat deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſuffer by others, that our imperfections are diſcovered and made known, and that we are cenſur'd for undertaking to aim at perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. All this tending to humble us is good, what way ſoever it come, and no better thing can arrive unto us. To be faithful on theſe occaſions doth far tranſcend all ſpeculations. If you ſtill complain of croſs accidents; if you don't hide your ſelf from the eyes of men; if you love not poverty and contempt, and the things of this world have ſtill ſome hold upon you; thou art not annihilated, and God hath not wrought the marvels of his love in thy heart.</p>
                  <p>Hearing ſung in the Church theſe words of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>In toto corde meo exquiſivi Te; I have ſought Thee, O Lord, with my whole heart;</hi> it ſeemed to me, that our bleſſed Saviour an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd me interiourly, <hi>Thou haſt made a fair ſearch after me every where; but thou wilt not find me any where on Earth, but there where I have been in the ſtations of my mortal life; in ſolitude and ſilence, in poverty and ſufferings, in perſecution and reproaches, in croſſes and annihilation. The Saints find me in Heaven in the ſplendors of Glory, and Joys ineffable; but this is after they have found me on Earth in Diſgraces and Pains</hi> I am
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57606:33"/> throughly convinc'd of this Truth, and humbly thank our bleſſed Saviour, for making it ſo clear unto me; and I beſeech his infinite goodneſs ſo to imprint it in my heart, that I may practice it without delay.</p>
                  <p>Alas! how long ſhall I behold the excellency of humiliations by Divine Irradiations darted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Soul, and practice them ſo little? Divine Jeſus! take from me this rebellious heart, if it refuſe to be conformable to you in your annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, open my breaſt, and take it from me; for I had rather have none at all, and die, than have a heart that has other Maxims and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons than what you have taught me. O my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Jeſus! I do not in this deſire cruelty to my ſelf, but a ſignal favour. The eternal Father who beheld you hanging on the Croſs with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, will not be offended with this bloody ſpectacle.</p>
                  <p>O my Jeſus! what a love have I for your Croſs and humiliations! The view of their beauty, ſo well-pleaſing to your eternal Father, does at preſent ſo raviſh and tranſport me, that I ſhall become as it were a Fool, I ſhall loſe my ſenſes, and ſpeak I know not what; unleſs, dear Jeſus, you put a ſtop to your Divine motions, and eclipſe thoſe Heavenly Rays which preſent to my view ſufferings and humiliations ſo ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                  <p>I have a particular Devotion to make a <hi>Litany</hi> of Jeſus in all his humiliations; and when I feel a repugnancy to the practice of annihilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſelf-denial, I find great encouragement by reciting it.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XIV. <hi>That a Soul eſpouſing Jeſus Christ, eſpouſes alſo his Croſs and Sufferings.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe infinite Wiſdom of God has condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to eſpouſe the lowneſs of our human Nature, by his Incarnation. This ſame human Nature hath eſpous'd the Croſs, Sufferings, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, Death; and when a Soul eſpouſes Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, ſhe contracts an eternal Union with all theſe during her Pilgrimage. O happy Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance! She is married to Jeſus, and Contempts and Sufferings are the Dowry. O precious Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches! If ſhe love her Beloved indeed, ſhe ought to have a tender affection to the gifts ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to him at the Eſpouſals, becauſe ſhe gives them, and he much values them.</p>
                  <p>O my Soul! being thus eſpouſed to Jeſus Chriſt, behold then how ſtrictly thou art bound and engaged to him; for hereafter thou muſt ſuffer pains of body, griefs of mind, affronts and injuries; thou muſt be well content with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations, love diſgraces, and make ſport for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; thou muſt be content to be thought but unconſtant by Devotes, and of little underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by worldly perſons; thou ought'ſt not to be diſcourag'd at bad ſucceſſes, and thereupon drink deep of the Cup of humiliations, whether thou be in fault, or not; to be content to ſee others advanced, and willingly embrace a low condition. O my Soul! this engagement may terrifie thee; but take courage, thou canſt
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57606:35"/> do all things, through Chriſt ſtrengthening thee.</p>
                  <p>Jeſus Chriſt was praedeſtinated from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſufferings and abjections, by the Decree of his Heavenly Father, to ſatisfie for our ſins. And 'tis certain that all the Friends of God are praedeſtinated to be conformable to Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo are praedeſtinated to ſufferings, to ſatisfie God offended, and repair his Glory. Whoſoever therefore refuſes ſufferings and humiliations, forſakes the way of the Praedeſtinate, for doubtleſs, by how much the more a Soul parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipates of the ſtates of the life of Jeſus, ſo much the more is ſhe in God's favour, being more conform to the great Exemplar of thoſe who are praedeſtinated to Life eternal.</p>
                  <p>Croſſes and humiliations are beſt for Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and nothing does them more hurt than temporal Proſperity. O my God! burn, kill, mortifie, diſgrace, debaſe, crucifie me, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I ſhall not have your face and favour, nor be numbred among your Friends. Make me wiſe in good earneſt, to the end I may walk in your ways, that I may have a love for croſſes and humiliations, that my heart may not be at reſt, till it reſt there, as in a Centre.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould never have believed, if experience did not make it evident, that a Soul can be brought to ſuch a ſtate by the conduct of Grace, as to rejoyce exceedingly to be plung'd in all ſorts of miſeries. But theſe joys are ſo pleaſant, and ſo ſweet, that after a reliſh of their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, all things upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Earth ſeem nothing to them. A Soul then much wonders at her ſelf,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57606:35"/> to be terrified ſo much with the ſight of abje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ſeeing now they ſeem to her a Coeleſtial Paradice; and, next to Heaven, ſhe deſires no other: for ſhe knows that Jeſus Chriſt enjoy'd on Earth both theſe Paradices, that of <hi>Glory in Heaven,</hi> and this of <hi>Humiliations on Earth.</hi> She knows, that in the Paradice of Glory, ſhe ſhall be glorified of God; ſhe knows, that in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice ſhe conceives to be in Croſſes and Abje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, God is glorified by Her. This is that which makes her have ſuch an eſteem and love for ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>She thinks it a puniſhment to part with this Paradice; and ſhe cannot ſufficiently lament the blindneſs of men, who hunt after Honours and Preferments, of which ſhe has no ſmall ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency. She ſees clearly, that thoſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to Honours, commonly ſeek their own Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: but by ſelf-denial and abjections we aim at the Glory of God; And therefore, laying moſt to heart the Glory of God, ſhe falls in love with humiliations.</p>
                  <p>A Soul once enlightned with theſe irradiations, if ſhe refuſe abjections and ſufferings, is very faithleſs, and deſerves to be in the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out croſſes and humiliations, which is the moſt formidable chaſtiſement that can happen to us upon Earth.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>LEt us not imagine we have the Spirit of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and true humility, becauſe we are affected with the thoughts and ſentiments thereof, for we can only know it aſſuredly in the effective occaſions. O how rare a thing is it to be wholly crucified to the things of this life! Nature muſt pay dear to purchaſe this Jewel. 'Tis not becauſe the fruits are not ſweet, which are indeed ſo raviſhing, that no other ſweetneſs in the world may be compared to it; inſomuch that thoſe Souls who have once taſted thereof, <hi>are,</hi> as I may ſay, <hi>daily mounted on the Croſs, as a Tree of Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Search for ſweetneſs where you pleaſe, you will never find it ſo full as in the boſom of the Croſs; all other ſweetneſs is but ſuperficial and fleeting; this is ſolid, permanent, and efficacious. But this a Soul cannot know by thoughts only, and ſentiments thereof, but by the real effects of ſuffering. Some Souls are as St <hi>Cordula,</hi> in whom the weakneſs of Nature was ſo ſtrong, that ſhe hid her ſelf to eſcape Martyrdom; but the power of Jeſus Chriſt made her a little after diſcover her ſelf, and lay down her life for his ſake.</p>
                  <p>There's a wonderful frailty in human Nature, but the power of Grace in man is marvellous;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57606:36"/> the ſight of <hi>One,</hi> makes us tremble for fear; but beholding the <hi>Other,</hi> we are encourag'd by hope. Humility, and confidence in God, are two Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues very neceſſary to man, who left to himſelf is all weakneſs, and is not ſtrong but by the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt, in whom poor, humble Souls arrive to their Crowns of Glory, and he is alſo crowned by them: for they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the World and Nature but by Him, and this puts eternal Crowns upon his Head. The Crowns which the Saints wear on their heads, belong not to them, as if they had gain'd them by their own abilites, but to Jeſus Chriſt, the Crown of the Bleſſed in Heaven; <hi>Jeſus Corona Sanctorum omnium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O dear Jeſus! I am well pleas'd with your ſweetneſs and conſolations, and with the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration you uſe towards me, in trying me only with ſmall afflictions, as well knowing my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would be over-whelm'd with a torrent of ſufferings. I am pleas'd with thoſe ſenſible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences you infuſe into my Soul in Devotions; for though they be evident ſigns of my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet they are aſſured effects of your amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Providence, to ſtrengthen my frailty againſt temptations. Glorifie then in the depth of my Miſery the riches of your Mercy.</p>
                  <p>When a Soul calls to mind her imperfections, and inclination to evil, God thinks upon her, and ſupplies her with his aſſiſting Graces. When ſhe forgets her miſeries and corruptions, God alſo forgets her; for he loves not <hi>Vanity,</hi> but <hi>Verity.</hi> For this reaſon the moſt uſual exerciſe of a Soul ought to be to endeavour for a perfect
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57606:37"/> ſight of her imperfections. This is an Altar on which we ſacrifice all ſelf-conceits, and deſire of our proper excellence, to do homage to the ſovereign Perfection and infinite Majeſty of God. This Altar ought to be every day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</p>
                  <p>What corrections and reproofs we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from others, are not to be thought full of paſſion and exaggeration; yea, they come from our greateſt Enemies: for they are leſs than our ſins and corruption, the ſource where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is ſo profound, that no Creature can fathom it, but God alone. O what a blindneſs is it then to complain!</p>

                  <p>'Tis true alſo, that being convinced of her own unworthineſs, ſhe has no confidence in her ſelf, but in God alone, to whom entirely ſhe gives up her ſelf, to deal with her as he pleaſes in Mercy or Juſtice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>She wonders not to ſee her ſelf left and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd to ſin, becauſe ſhe knows ſhe deſerves no better, and then bleſſes the Divine Mercy, for not dealing with her according to her Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>

                  <p>To acknowledge, and be content with our own baſeneſs, is one of the greateſt mercies God can do for a Soul. For hereby ſhe draws Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from Perdition, as God knows how to advance his Glory by our ſins. A Soul thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, is content to be ſet on the Dunghil of her miſeries, ſurrounded with humiliations for her faults, as <hi>Job</hi> was with afflictions: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding her ſelf as it were the <hi>Queen of Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Abjections,</hi> ſhe's pleas'd therewith, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe may thereby honour and magnifie the Divine Goodneſs. If a Soul be miſerable by fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into ſin, ſhe is rich in poſſeſſing the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of humiliation after her failings. But this is a truth hidden to moſt men, who do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover this advanrage. They are poor, and yet have a Treaſure in their Field, which they may have for digging.</p>
                  <p>Jeſus, poor and abject for love of me, leave me not to my ſelf; lift up my Soul after her fall, and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p> Methinks, dear Jeſus, I already feel your ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs unto me; your divine love vouchſafes me a reliſh of the ſweets of Paradice; my eyes are bath'd in tears of contentment; my heart is dilated; and love does firmly unite me to you. Wherefore do you vouchſafe the kiſs of Peace ſo ſoon to ſuch a Wretch as I am? Why do you not leave me in bitterneſs of Soul, and trouble of Spirit, as a juſt chaſtiſement for my ſins? Your Mercy will not ſo deal with me, but by wonderful preventions of love, in the midſt of my infirmities you redouble your favours and conſolations. O that I was all love, to ſerve you wholly by way of gratitude! I would have all the world to ſee my Infidelities, to the end your mercy may ſhine more glorious.</p>
                  <p>I know that the ſight of my ſin had ſo frozen my heart, as in a manner to make me liveleſs: but, O my Jeſus, you have provided an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent remedy, ſeeing the flames of divine love have ſet me all on fire to do your will. 'Tis a great favour to be in this temper of Soul; but, dear Jeſus, ſtay not here, viſit my heart again with the feelings of your humiliations, that your inſcrutable abjections may be its centre, and render it in ſome ſort conformable to yours: and do this miracle of your Grace, that this faithleſs heart may become a divine heart, by the infinite merit of your moſt precious Blood.</p>

                  <p>HOw is a Soul pleaſed to know that her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy muſt return to duſt! This humiliation is the object of her complacency. When the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrations of a Divine Light clear up the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, then ſhe knows that perfection con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a tendence to humiliation, wherein ſhe meets with the exaltation of God by the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable contrivance of the Divine Wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>O duſt and aſhes! you may be terrible to worldly Souls, but I am ſure you bring joy to thoſe who (walking by the light of Faith and conduct of Grace) love dearly the intereſts of God, and life eternal. The loſs of worldly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, Honour, Contentment, is painful to Nature, too much attached to her ſelf: but a Soul elevated by Grace, rejoyces at the loſs of her own intereſts, to advance God's glory.</p>
                  <p>A Soul ought to be well-pleas'd that her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhall be crumbled to duſt, and (as it were) reduced to nothing, to exalt the Glory of God, and glorifie his Juſtice. A holy perſon much wondred how the Saints, who are powerful with God, kept their bodies ſo long entire, not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that they might be humbled by putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; becauſe they knowing the ineſtimable value of humiliation, which moſt glorifies God, ought, as it ſeems, to have procur'd it to their
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57606:40"/> bodies. But if God think beſt to glorifie himſelf by preſerving them from corruption, his Divine Will is, and muſt be, the Rule of their deſires.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes I have deſired death as amiable, becauſe it would give me free acceſs to enjoy God; but at preſent I have the ſpirit of annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. This annihilation is a ſtate above that of death, and by it we offer a perfect Sacrifice. A Soul which ſeeks the Glory of God, deſires death to enter into this perfect annihilation. What is moſt horrible in Death, paleneſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, noiſomneſs, putrefaction, pleaſes her beſt, for theſe are companions of a perfect an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation, to humble her as much as poſſible. O death! how lovely art thou to ſuch a Soul!</p>
                  <p>'Tis a ſtrange thing, that the fire of Divine Love burns no brighter in our hearts, upon the frequenting of the Sacraments. Oftentimes we exerciſe our ſelves twice a day in mental Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſometimes by holy Conferences, daily Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures and Conſiderations. Now I think the cauſe of this is, that we are ſad, dejected with abjections, which ſo chills the heart, that the fire of Divine Love is ſtifled thereby: but when once humiliation is a joy unto us, the heart preſently becomes enflamed.</p>
                  <p>My Soul having a great deguſt of this life, feels a wonderful deſire of death; ſhe never was more ſenſible than now of her Captivity and Priſon in this mortal body. She ſighs after the liberty to ſee God, and enjoy him without any diſturbance whatſoever: for all created things do divert this happy exerciſe, in which conſiſts her felicity. Being a Priſoner in this
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57606:40"/> Body, ſhe is yet in darkneſs and diſtractions, by eating, ſleeping, ſeveral affairs and accidents. O how is ſhe crucified in being deprived of the full Embraces of her Beloved! <hi>Quis me libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit de corpore mortis hujus?</hi> This made St. <hi>Paul</hi> earneſtly deſire to be freed from the Priſon of this mortal body.</p>
                  <p>I admire the happineſs of thoſe who die in our Lord; and do wonder at the blindneſs of of ſuch who paſſionately deſire this preſent life, and are taken up ſo much with the care of the Body, Goods, Employments, which are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny impediments of our converſe with God, and Chriſtian Perfection. O how importunate is ſenſuality with us, and yet how contemptible is every thing that is not God! We ought not to be diſcomforted at the loſs of temporal things, becauſe thereby ſome chains of our Captivity are broken: Much leſs ought we to be troubl'd to ſee our Body, the Priſon of our Soul, to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by degrees, and threaten death. Take cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; we ſhall ſoon ſee our deſires accompliſh'd, and ſhortly we ſhall enjoy God in full poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>This ſtate of deſires and languiſhings after God, is a ſtate whereby we honour him as our final happineſs: and being ſo, he deſerves by reaſon of his excellence, that we ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſigh after him. Such as have no love for their final end, make no matter of it, and give too much evidence, that they find their repoſe in ſomething elſe, which is a moſt dreadful diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. But conſidering our happineſs by death, methinks I ſee nothing more lovely than croſſes and abjections; which can only refreſh a Soul
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57606:41"/> panting after the full poſſeſſion of God, and ſometimes ſo content with it, that ſhe forgets the pain of her baniſhment; ſeeing her ſelf in a ſtate wherein ſhe may glorifie God in ſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent in a manner; which is what ſhe chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſires, aſpiring to enjoyment, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving regard to her proper ſatisfaction.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>A Stone held in the Air, if let go, falls natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to the ground by its own weight: and 'tis no more matter of wonder, when we fall into imperfections. If God leave us to our ſelves, we are preſently in our own nothing, weakneſs and infirmity. And if the Grace of God was not very great unto us, we ſhould fall more often.</p>
                  <p>They may be thought valiant, who bear up ſtoutly againſt the blaſt of ſtrong temptations. Alas! take us at the beſt, we are as frail as Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes on a Cupboard: If ſome are ſooner broken, 'tis becauſe they are more uſed, and found in the hand of an ill manager. Thoſe that ſtand ſtill on the Cupboard, if they had reaſon, would not brag of their ſtrength, but only acknowledg, <hi>that they have not been tryed by occaſions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Grace of God keeps us from falling we ought not to take complacence therein, as if we were better than others by reaſon of ſuch
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57606:41"/> Divine Favours; but our content ought to be in the good pleaſure of God, who is ſo munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to his Creatures, yea, the moſt unworthy. To be thus pleas'd only with God's will, is alſo very neceſſary, when it is God's pleaſure to leave a Soul to combat with ſome ſingular imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction a long time without victory. For it being the will of God to leave a Soul thus to fight it out, ſhe ought to be as well content as if ſhe was more elevated by Grace, ſeeing in this ſtate ſhe meets with the Divine pleaſure, which is the object of her complacency. Inſomuch that the Soul has no more inclination for one Grace than another, but indifferent to all, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have her faults made known, to glorifie God by the love of abjection. Secret faults do us the greateſt hurt; when manifeſted, if we make good uſe of it, they may bring no ſmall advantage to us.</p>
                  <p>I have at preſent a wonderful diſtaſt of this Life, which is hardly a Life, but a continual Death, becauſe it deprives us of knowledg and and love in perfection. O how this mortal life is a great puniſhment, and full of Croſſes! Here we ſin, here we forget God, and run a hazard to loſe him eternally. Love here finds little nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, being fed with ſlender knowledg, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times much clouded, and continual propenſions to evil. Dear Saviour! <hi>when will you deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> This was the deſire of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which I take the courage to make, being ſo much out of love with this miſerable life.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>WE can never attain Perfection by the ſole conduct of human reaſon, which is the light of Philoſophers. <hi>Faith</hi> is the light of Chriſtians, which teacheth us to renounce the ratiocinations of carnal prudence, to follow in ſimplicity a <hi>Jeſus Crucified.</hi> To obſerve the Commandments of God, as to their ſubſtance, is to keep our ſelves in the bounds of human reaſon, to which they are conformable: but to obſerve them in an elevated manner, ſo as our obedience may be meritorious; to follow Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſpirations, in loving Contempts, Poverty, Mortifications, and embrace Evangelical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels:
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57606:43"/> To do this, we muſt be elevated above our ſelves, and live a <hi>Supernatural Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>See then what I underſtand by a Supernatural and Chriſtian Life. To live Chriſtianly, is to live according to the Spirit of Jeſus, according to the Grace of Jeſus, the <hi>New Man.</hi> A Grace far different from the Grace given to old <hi>Adam,</hi> in the ſtate of Innocency. A Life more holy and more eminent, and which carries along with it different effects, and contrary proceedings.</p>
                  <p>The Grace of <hi>Adam</hi> did enable him to uſe the Creatures virtuouſly, and by the holy uſe of Pleaſures, Honours, and Riches, to arrive to his final happineſs. This was the way of the ſtate of Innocency; from whence being fallen, the infinite Wiſdom hath found out another way quite different, which is the way of privations, of the Croſs, of ſufferings, of humiliations, in which Jeſus Chriſt marched from the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Incarnation, to his laſt breath on the Croſs.</p>
                  <p>This is the true foundation of the Chriſtian Life; this is the true Principle, this is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way, out of which there is no Salvation, or Perfection. Worldly men, and too many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, are ignorant of it; and not knowing <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereminentem Scientiam Jeſu Chriſti,</hi> this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent Science of Jeſus Chriſt, they know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as they ought, becauſe they know not Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus crucified. This Doctrine is harſh to fleſh and blood, and wholly contrary to the Spirit of the World. But the Saints have practis'd it, and I muſt walk the ſame way, except I will be very faithleſs, and renonnce the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:57606:43"/>
                  <p> O my God! I will become a <hi>New Man</hi> in my Underſtanding, Will, Life, Proceedings; and to this end I will change my Doctrine, my Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Maxims. I will deny my ſelf, and take up my Croſs to follow Jeſus; I will be content with Poverty, Contempt, and Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; my inclinations ſhall tend this way for the future, and ſufferings for your ſake ſhall be delights unto me. And if I do otherwiſe, it ſhall not be through wilfulneſs, but human weakneſs. O good Jeſus! give me to live with you a crucified Life on Earth, that you may make me partaker of your glorified Life in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. There is a time for all things. This is a life of Sufferings, the other of Enjoyments.</p>
                  <p>O blindneſs of Chriſtians, not to ſee the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Chriſtian Life! Some are buſie to make themſelves fit for worldly Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; ſome are all for Science; others for War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but few make it their chief work to become good Chriſtians, as being of little value with them. O the ignorance of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, not to ſee that all things beſides are pure vanity!</p>

                  <p>JESUS on the day of his Aſcenſion was eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the higheſt Heavens, where he ſits at the right hand of God: upon which my Soul rejoyc'd with her Saviour in admiration of his Tryumphs, and breathing out after him a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Praiſes and Benedictions with all Saints and Angels, found motions in my ſelf to follow him, not to Heaven, but to <hi>Mount Calvary,</hi> not in his Tryumphs but Humiliations. <hi>O my Jeſus!</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>that I was elevated above my ſelf; that I could ſo keep Nature under, as to live a ſupernatural Life, and tryumphing over human Reaſon, and natural Maxims, I may repoſe quietly in the Boſom of your Croſs, and there live happily in that content the world knows not, with that peace which paſſeth all understanding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I know that all the Patriarchs which you led in tryumph, were juſtly raviſhed with joys unspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; But if you pleaſe to raiſe me by Grace to a ſupernatural Life, I will not envy their happineſs. They are elevated to Enjoyment; but as for me, I am for Privation, for Contempt and Miſeries, which ſeem to me, being ſuffered for your ſake, dear Jeſus, more delicious than Paradice. If I perſevere with Fidelity in a crucified Life, I will not trouble my ſelf about the life of Glory. But, alas! my frequent falls and failings, by reaſon of</hi>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:57606:44"/> 
                     <hi>my weakneſs and inconſtancy, make me deſire that Life, where is no fault or imperfection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The aſcenſion of a Soul to Heaven, O how delightful is it! the aſcenſion of a Soul to a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Life, O 'tis admirable! How happy are they who are acquainted with it! O my God! clear up the eye of Faith in me, that I may behold the wonders you work in Souls in this valley of tears. What if I ſay, <hi>That a Soul is as happy and tryumphant in going out of her ſelf, for the love of the Croſs to embrace abjection, as in going out of the World to poſſeſs Heaven?</hi> So many ſallies as ſhe makes out of her ſelf for the love of the Croſs, are ſo many glorious aſcenſions, which delight even God himſelf, the Saints and Angels beholding it with admiration. The ſame Faith which opens my eyes to ſee Jeſus poor and abject, does aſſure me that the triumph of a Soul in humiliations, is no leſs admirable than in Glory.</p>
                  <p>What can be done more to make us have the higheſt eſteem of this ſupernatural Life, when we ſee God the Father, among ſo many poſſible ways, hath from all eternity choſen this for his Son, while he liv'd upon Earth? How did his well-beloved Son, who is infinitely wiſe, leave the boſom of his Father with joy, to embrace this life with love and affection! How did the holy Spirit, who repoſed in his breaſt as the centre of his more noble ſentiments, carry him on by moſt powerful inſpirations to the Croſs, Contempts, Poverty, Humiliations, during the whole courſe of this mortal life!</p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:57606:45"/>
                  <p> What other way can thoſe who belong unto Chriſt take to make themſelves conformable to him, but by treading in his ſteps? But when our bleſſed Saviour liv'd in the world this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful life, <hi>Mundus eum non cognovit,</hi> the world knew him not, becauſe he lay hid in poverty, pains and ſufferings. In like manner thoſe who live a life moſt conformable to him, <hi>the world knows them not;</hi> for we muſt have eyes cleared by Divine Irradiations to diſcover the excellency of this ſtate. And yet ſo much Glory and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur is enveloped in the ſhadows of this Life, that they who live it, do moſt glorifie God, and exalt his Honour.</p>
                  <p>Take courage then, and let us tend to the perfection of Divine Love, which we ſhall find in the ſolid practice of this ſupernatural Life. Let others do what they pleaſe, we will follow the conduct of God's holy Spirit, and march ſtoutly after Jeſus Chriſt, abject and crucified.</p>
                  <p>O what happy advantages enjoys that Soul, to whom God is pleas'd to give a view of this ſupernatural Life, a Life hidden and unknown to worldly men! 'Tis of more worth than all the Treaſures of the Earth We ought daily (according to our abilities) to examine our ſelves, to the end to purifie our hearts from all affections that tend not to this ſupernatural Life. It reſides in the ſuperiour part of the Soul; and therefore we muſt not wonder, if the inferiour part has deguſts and averſions from it.</p>
                  <p>We muſt expect, that Nature, Senſe, Friends, the World, and ordinary Chriſtians, will keep
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57606:45"/> a noiſe, and trouble our ears with many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt it: But to all this it is enough to anſwer in few words with St. <hi>Blandina, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana ſum, Chriſtiana ſum;</hi> I am a Chriſtian. Let us ſay to ſuch who endeavour to divert us, <hi>I have undertaken to lead this ſupernatural Life; I will never abandon it, maugre all the contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of worldly Maxims, and the repugnances of ſenſual Nature. I know, to become a perfect Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, I muſt be turn'd up-ſide down, destroy'd, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated, according to my natural inclinations, hate in a manner all that the world naturally loves, Riches, Honours, Pleaſures, (yea, though inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent;) and love what the world naturally hates, Poverty, Contempt and Sufferings.</hi> This is a great attempt, but we have powerful helps; for <hi>we can do all things through Chriſt ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us.</hi>

                  <p>I Am now reſolv'd in good earneſt to convert my ſelf wholly to God, to be taken ſolely with his Divine Beauty, and Infinite Goodneſs, forſaking all Creatures, which heretofore have too much taken up my time and affections.</p>
                  <p>O my God! deal with me as you did with your Apoſtle; ſtrike me down to the ground; humble me; make me blind to all things but to You, who are in the interiour of my heart,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57606:46"/> beaming forth Lights, which diſcover ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently your Divine preſence.

                  </p>
                  <p>Behold, it ſeems to me, this is what you would have me to do. Firſt, <hi>Not to perſecute the ſentiments and inclinations I have to a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Life, by taking part with the ſtruglings of old</hi> Adam <hi>in me.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> perſecuted Jeſus Chriſt, in perſecuting the Primitive Chriſtians; and I alſo perſecute the ſame Jeſus, when I ſtifle the motions of Grace in me, and will not ſuffer my Soul to live his life, which he did lead here for me to follow. Pardon me, good Jeſus; I will no longer perſecute you by ſtifling your holy Inſpirations. I deſire to be a Chriſtian and your Diſciple. I will profeſs Chriſtianity in the face of the Sun, and only be aſham'd to live after the Law of old <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To be a Chriſtian, this is my Glory, this is my Life, this is my Delight. Poverty, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, Pains, Humiliations, I will no more be affraid of you, but make much of you, ſeeing Jeſus hath loved you even to death.</p>
                  <p>To live this Life, we muſt become blind, and have no other light than what the rays of Faith afford us For Nature cannot teach us the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur Excellence, and Eminency of Chriſtianity. St <hi>Paul</hi> after his Converſion ſuffered a thouſand hardſhips; He was whipt, baniſh'd, deſpis'd,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57606:46"/> mock'd, impriſon'd, tormented, us'd as if he was the filth and off-ſcouring of the world: which is as much as to ſay, St. <hi>Paul</hi> after his Converſion was a Chriſtian to death; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could deter him from living the life of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Let us then, O my Soul, be true Chriſtians, that is, let us be content to live in Sufferings, Perſecutions, Mortifications, and the Ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Croſs of Jeſus Chriſt. Let us em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the wiſdom of the <hi>Word Incarnate,</hi> and become as Fools in the eyes of the world, who perſecute true Chriſtians; that is, thoſe who die to themſelves, and all things elſe, to live to Jeſus. Poor Chriſtian Life, little art thou known how ill art thou treated in the world! Thou dwell'ſt in the lips of many, but few afford thee a place in their heart.</p>
                  <p>I am fully perſuaded, that a Soul truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted loves God entirely; that this entire love of God is a perfect union with his goodneſs; that ſuch a union implies a univerſal detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Creature; that ſuch a detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot be got without the profeſſion of Virtues, and among the reſt, Poverty and Self-denial, by which we are interiourly diſengaged from earthly things; and exteriourly, when God pleaſes, contentedly ſuffer miſeries, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, loſs of Goods, and whatever the world naturally abhors as evil; but by the work of Grace are for our greater good, becauſe they advance our union with God.</p>
                  <p>When we abound with Riches and Honours, we live in a continual fear of having too great
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57606:47"/> an affection for them; but in ſufferings a Soul poſſeſſes a ſtronger aſſurance of Divine Love. Nothing but Grace can teach us theſe verities, and a greater Grace can only make us reliſh and practice them: the weight of our natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations ſtill hindring us from riſing to ſo great Perfection.</p>
                  <p>When we give up our ſelves to God, with reſolutions daily to advance in Virtue, we can more eaſily conceive what this perfection is, than practice it. However, let us take courage, nothing is impoſſible to God, and we ſhall find (doubtleſs) this Jewel by a perfect abnegation: that is, poſſeſſing nothing, not the very means of ſerving God, but with a ſpirit of reſignation To follow Jeſus naked on the Croſs, we muſt diveſt our ſelves of all Creatures, that we may be ſolely united to him.</p>
                  <p>Yea, dear Jeſus, my deſire is only to be for you; my reſolution is to ſerve you, and in what manner you pleaſe, be it by action, or by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, or contemplation.

                  <p>AFter many illuſtrations of Grace, which have cleared up to me the beauty of the ſacred Folly of the Croſs; after many propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals and reviews: I have at laſt eſpous'd it; ſaying with fervour the ſame words which Chriſt us'd to his Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles; Sponſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo te in aeternum: My Friend, my Spouſe, my Sister, I have eſpouſed thee for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Methinks I ſay theſe words, <hi>for ever,</hi> but yet faintly, my infinite frailties making me fearful I may become an inconſtant Lover. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, I ſay <hi>for ever</hi> with a real heart, in hope, that by virtue of that immenſe Love whereby the Divinity hath for ever eſpouſed our human Nature, and this ſame Humanity hath eſpouſed the Croſs, ſufferings and abjections, our bleſſed Saviour will vouchſafe me ſome part of the Grace of this Divine Alliance, to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me to walk his way, and live his life, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> humiliations and ſelf-denial.</p>
                  <p>Let us then, O my Soul, live this life of the Son of God; any other life is but a real death. Jeſus hath eſpouſed the folly of the Croſs, and 'tis his will I ſhall do ſo likewiſe; and ſhall not I do his will? O my God! I am content to be depriv'd of what the world loves and deſires; leave but me the folly of the Croſs, I ſhall be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57606:48"/> rich enough. O amiable folly! he who knows thee, cannot but love thee: What a fool have I been, to embrace thee no ſooner!</p>
                  <p>Behold, my Soul, thou art engaged, and this engagement makes thee fearful: <hi>Quare triſtis es anima mea, &amp; quare conturbas me?</hi> But why, O my Soul, art thou diſquieted? 'Tis true, for the future thou muſt ſuffer injuries, affronts, pains of body, troubles of mind, be content with annihilations and abjections; be pleas'd with diſgraces; be the play-game of Worldlings, and eſteemed as a Fool; yea, to be ill ſpoken of by ſome Devotes: Thou muſt not be caſt down with ill ſucceſſes, whether thou be in fault, or no: Thou muſt drink deep of the Cup of humiliations; ſee others exalted, and love to be humbled; yea, though by ſpiritual Deſolations. Take cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, O my Soul, we can do all things through Chriſt ſtrengthening us.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs the greatneſs of my engagement would have quite caſt me down, being ſenſible of my own wonderful weakneſs, if I had not been ſupported by the infinite mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God. Wherefore I muſt love the Croſs, which I have eſpouſed for ever. I ſhall find my ſelf well enough in this alliance, if I do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue faithful; for the more I converſe with it, I ſhall the more diſcover its Beauty; my fears will vaniſh, my paſſions will be appeas'd; and being in peace, my Soul will be enlarged, and melt in love towards this Spouſe; which, tho' <hi>black,</hi> is <hi>wonderful comely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If I love the Croſs, it muſt needs be an effect of pure Grace, my own frailties bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: but at preſent I find my ſelf in great diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57606:48"/> of love. O how weak is my Soul, when left to her ſelf! O how ſtrong is ſhe, when ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Grace! O my Jeſus! 'tis your love, and your example that makes me love the ſacred folly of the Croſs, which you have ſo dearly loved, as to die in its embraces.</p>
                  <p>When I conſider a God crucified, methinks I diſcover certain rays of Beauty, which make the horror of <hi>Mount Calvary</hi> ſeem wonderful ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and I can hardly be ſatisfied with looking on this lovely object, and ſay; <hi>O my Jeſus! how delightful is it to ſee the beauty of a God dying for men!</hi> This beauty indeed is not in his ſacred vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, for that was all disfigured with blood and buffettings; but in that God was pleaſed to die on the Croſs for men, and the eternal Father took complacence in this beauty. I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate what is this beauty, unleſs by the effect it produces in me; for verily my Soul ſees nothing beſides this to captivate my ſight: Jeſus only in his humiliations and ſufferings on the Croſs, commands my eyes and my heart.</p>
                  <p>When I conſider the other ſtates of the life of Jeſus; his Incarnation, Nativity, Solitude, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and the like; I find in them a beauty invites me to behold them with delight, becauſe I diſcover certain irradiations to beam from the obſcurities and humiliations of theſe ſtates, which are very raviſhing. I often ſay with my ſelf, <hi>How lovely is the abjection of this ſtate!

                  <head>CHAP. V. <hi>How we ought to conform our Interiour to that of Jeſus Christ.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>OUr Interiour ought to be conformable to that of Jeſus Chriſt, that as his Members we may be governed and animated by his Spirit, that having part of his Grace as Chriſtians, part of his light from his Doctrine, part of his incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to put us upon practice, we may be ſo transformed into Jeſus, as to have a perfect uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him. And this is that wherein lies the excellency of a Chriſtian; this is that which makes Chriſtians indeed, and to do and ſuffer as becomes Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a ſtrange thing to ſee what little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we have of the Chriſtian life. Some who have left Nature, to follow Grace, ſuppoſe it conſiſts in doing much for God, and for the good of our Neighbour, by preaching inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, giving Alms, and ſuch-like charitable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes. This is good indeed; but we muſt form
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57606:49"/> the <hi>Interiour Christian,</hi> and then we ſhall do beſt for others what God calls us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Interiour</hi> conſiſts in Illuſtrations inward Teachings, Sentiments, and affections of the Soul. If thoſe be high and elevated, the <hi>Interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> is ſo likewiſe. But the Soul of Jeſus had the moſt elevated illuſtrations poſſible of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Self-denial, Poverty, Pains, Abjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the Croſs; and from thence a ſingular love and eſteem for them. Theſe irradiations and affections were infus'd into his moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soul, the firſt moment of his Incarnation, and continued to his laſt breath on the Croſs.</p>
                  <p>The eternal Father, who by this <hi>New Adam</hi> would repair his Glory, which was obſcur'd by <hi>Old Adam</hi>'s fall; amongſt the infinity of means which lay treaſur'd up in the boſom of his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience and Omnipotency, choſe this of the Croſs, which his Son (made <hi>Fleſh)</hi> embraced, cheriſhed, loved, and put in execution all his life-time; eſteeming Contempts, Croſſes, Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, as things great and excellent; prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the intereſt of the Glory of his Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſatisfactions of his ſacred Humanity, which had a natural repugnance to them. By how much the more then that a Soul is parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the Divine Spirit and Interiour of the Son of God, by ſo much the more ſhe eſteems and loves the Croſs, and conſequently does more glorifie God the Father. For, to ſuffer, is to make a continual Sacrifice of our Pleaſures and Intereſts, uniting our ſelves to the deſign the Son of God had by ſuffering to repair the Glory of his Father.</p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:57606:50"/>
                  <p> Wherefore, when a Soul ceaſes to value and love the Croſs and Humiliations, ſhe is no more conform to the Soul of Jeſus, and ſo does not glorifie God the Father in a high manner: but when ſhe feels in her ſelf a high eſteem and love of the Croſs, ſhe highly glorifies the eternal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who takes great delight in her, in that ſhe reſembles his well-beloved Son.</p>
                  <p>When a Soul is enlightned with theſe irradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, ſhe ſees her Glory is to be deſpiſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe her Glory is to procure the Glory of God, which ſhe does moſt by humiliations. She finds her delight to be in ſuffering, becauſe her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is to honour the eternal Father, which is beſt effected by this means. A faithful Soul will never part with an eſteem and love of the Croſs, as to the Interiour, becauſe her deſire is to pleaſe God, and we beſt pleaſe him by humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations.</p>
                  <p>Let us well ground our ſelves in this exerciſe of the deſigns of God, who would have us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to his Son, and conſequently to have a love for ſufferings and abjections. Whatever diſpoſes us to this conformity, ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to us; as, few natural Talents, Sickneſs, ill ſucceſſes, and the like. The Spirit of the World and Nature find therein their puniſhment; but the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt takes pleaſure therein, and ſo advances a faithful Soul to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                  <p>We are not yet ſpiritualiz'd, if we be not faithful to the love of ſufferings and abjections. And we are not faithful herein, if we are not content with thoſe things that humble us, and cauſe abjection.</p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:57606:50"/>
                  <p> A right proſpect of abjection and ſufferings is ſupernatural and delicate, and requires time to bring it to perfection; and muſt be firſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our ſelves, before we extend it to others.</p>
                  <p>As for my particular, when I ſee a perſon in great miſery and poverty, I am not much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at it, becauſe I conſider the real good that Soul may procure to her ſelf by this abjection. On the contrary, I am in fear for thoſe who are advanced to Honours, and have great natural abilities, for the difficulty they muſt needs find to curb the Spirit of Nature and the World, and bring them off from the love of theſe things, which are ſo powerful in them, and hinder in them the love of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore remember, that the purity of Virtue conſiſts in a faithful tendance to abje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and ſuffering; and by how much a Soul is more faithful herein, the greater advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhe makes in Virtue. Abjection being as the centre of the Soul, the more ſhe is humbled, the nearer ſhe draws to her repoſe, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence has a greater feeling of God in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace. A Peace that the World nor Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can ever give us; a Peace that paſſeth all underſtanding.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>NOthing but God made man, poor, annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, ſacrificed, could honour God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his greatneſs. The deſigns of the eternal Father to this end are admirable, full of Divine Wiſdom, of unſpeakable Love and Mercy towards Man and moſt ardent Zeal for his own Glory. O the wonderful oeconomy that diſcovers it ſelf in all the myſteries of the <hi>Word Incarnate!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O the ineffable myſtery of Jeſus! By you the eternal Father is loved, glorified, honour'd, and his Juſtice ſatisfied to the utmoſt rigour. In this myſtery is contain'd an inexplicable Commerce and Trafique of God the Father with his Son, the Intereſt of his Glory, in the Salvation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. The will of the eternal Father was, that his Son ſhould be incarnate, circumciſed, poor, ſcorn'd and crucified; and the Son of God in all theſe ſtates of his life, intended thereby to render to his Father all the humiliations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, love, and adoration, which were due unto him. Theſe are the annihilations which ſo much elevate and exalt the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; to theſe ſhe owes her grandeur and excellence.</p>
                  <p>O amiable, eminent, and excellent Religion! how unknown art thou to wordly men, who taſt no ſweetneſs, but in ſenſual pleaſures! O
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57606:51"/> Chriſtian Religion! how art thou admirable! how art thou ineffable! whoſe chief buſineſs is to employ your Children with the Divine Trafique of the eternal Father, with his Son Incarnate. When thy Heavenly Lights ſhine upon a Soul, ſhe ſees the deceit, the vanity, and pitiful baſeneſs of the thoughts of thoſe men who love not God, nor aim at his Glory. O my Soul! how wretched wilt thou make thy ſelf, if thou follow thy ſenſual appetite, and walk not in the ways of Jeſus Chriſt! But this we cannot do of our ſelves, but by Grace and Power of the ſame Jeſus, who is our hope, and only helper.</p>
                  <p>We ought to bear no leſs reſpect to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims of a ſupernatural Life, than to Jeſus Chriſt, who hath eſtabliſh'd them; ſeeing we ought to believe that they are full of Divine Wiſdom, and ineffable Sanctity. To have no eſteem for poverty, contempt. and humiliations, is to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue the Wiſdom of Jeſus Chriſt. Some are ſo brutiſh, as to be led only by ſenſuality; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers follow only the light of Reaſon and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Prudence: but neither of them know the excellency of Chriſtianity, but ſuch only who are conducted by the light of Faith.</p>
                  <p>O Life ſupernatural! how ſublime art thou! How doſt thou ſo elevate a Soul, as to become blind to things here below, yea, to her ſelf, and to ſee nothing but God in her by the rays of Grace. Be pleaſed, O Divine Spirit of Jeſus, to beſtow upon us ſome part of this holy life, which the world can neither receive, nor know: <hi>Quem mundus non potest accipere, nec ſcit eum,</hi>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:57606:52"/> as St. <hi>John</hi> teſtifies. The world cannot receive it, being wholly taken up with Creatures; nor can know it, being blinded with ſenſuality. What a malediction is this! But what a happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is it to know and embrace this ſupernatural life!</p>
                  <p>This was wrought in the hearts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, who return'd with joy to be found worthy to live this life; that is, to be whipt and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for the name of Jeſus. Verily, if there was nothing to ſuffer here, I know not why we ſhou'd deſire to live here. We ſhould endeavour to imitate that great Saint who ſuffer'd a greater Martyrdom among Roſes and Suavities, than by Racks and Tortures. Worldly pleaſures are a kind of torment to a Soul that loves Jeſus Chriſt crucified.</p>
                  <p>Let us take a reſolution, O my Soul, not to be pleaſed but with the Croſs, and when that does not reliſh, let us pleaſe our ſelves with our own annihilation, ſeeing the Creature is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in effect, but what ſhe is in the ſight of God. But ſhe is no more in his eyes, than inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as ſhe is a Chriſtian; and ſhe is no more a Chriſtian, than inaſmuch as ſhe loves this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural life. While then we are too ſenſible of a ſuffering condition, we have no great ſhare of the ſpirit of Chriſtianity; that is, of the ſpirit of Jeſus, abject, ſuffering, and annihilated.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>There are divers degrees of this Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Life.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>GOD has been very gracious to us, to draw us out of nothing; but more gracious and merciful, in withdrawing us from ſin, and the occaſions of diſpleaſing him: But the choiceſt of his favours is, to advance us from a <hi>common,</hi> to a <hi>ſupernatural Life:</hi> That is, when the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Father does lead us into the ſtates of the mortal life of Jeſus, by abjections, ſufferings and annihilations; which is the choiceſt of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Favours on Earth, becauſe thereby we bring to him the greateſt Glory.</p>
                  <p>A Soul is not all at once elevated to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of this life. But as ſoon as ſhe beholds the beauty thereof, being aſhamed to be ſo much attached to worldly things, ſhe is taken with the excellency of this admirable way, and begins to be mortified to her ſelf and the world, aſpiring after a profound oblivion and contempt of all Creatures, and deſiring to be in privations, the better to curb her ſenſual inclinations, and practice Virtue. Thus the Soul proceeds in the purgative way of this ſupernatural Life.</p>
                  <p>The Soul thus purged, advances to partake of the Divine Illuminations of this Life, and becomes in a manner clear-ſighted thereby, her underſtanding receiving many illuſtrations and diſcoveries of its excellency and grandeur.</p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:57606:53"/>
                  <p> She ſees the wonders couch'd in the myſtery of Jeſus, poor, ſuffering, and annihilated. She perceives the eminency of thoſe ſanctified Souls who have followed Jeſus in his humiliations. She begins to apprehend, that a Soul which has no knowledge nor eſteem of this life, is buried in darkneſs. She is amaz'd at the blindneſs of Chriſtians, in being beſotted on empty vanities. And laſtly, ſhe perceives that there is enjoyment in ſuffering, and that by croſſes and privations we come to union with God.</p>
                  <p>The Soul thus illuminated, enters into the Unitive ſtate of this life, and tends to a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al union with God, whom ſhe ſees preſent in her Interiour. Nothing can hinder this union, as long as the Soul finds enjoyment in ſufferings. This proceeding of grace in a Soul is not extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary.</p>
                  <p>God behaves himſelf in a Soul, as a King in a Kingdom newly conquer'd, who kills and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys all that oppoſe the eſtabliſhment of his Dominion. Notwithſtanding the Prince here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſeems to put all things in diſorder, 'tis but to procure peace, and to rule without diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance by the conqueſt of his Enemies. God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in like manner: As ſoon as he enters into a Soul to ſet up his Kingdom, he makes a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock of all his Enemies by penetential rigour, to bring the Soul wholly to his Obedience.</p>
                  <p>Then he eſtabliſhes the Maxims of his Policy, and convinces the Soul how good and juſt they are by the following illuſtrations.</p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:57606:53"/>
                  <p> Firſt, <hi>That the greatest Treaſure on Earth is, to have part of the Poverty of Jeſus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>That the greatest Glory is, to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of his abjections.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>That the greateſt Joy is, to ſuffer pains with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>That the Life of Chriſtianity is, to deny our ſelves, take up our Croſs, and follow Jeſus. That when we ceaſe to die to our ſelves, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie our Luſts, we leave off to be Chriſtians, and die in a manner to Chriſtianity, becauſe we loſe the Spirit thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>That there's nothing more amiable, more precious, and more honourable in the world, than to imitate Jeſus poor and abject, ſeeino this ſtate was most precious in the eyes of God his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally, <hi>The Soul being perſuaded of theſe veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which are in a manner evident unto her, tho' by the obſcure light of Faith, has no love for any thing upon Earth, nor any pretenſions but thoſe of Jeſus Chriſt; and theſe were only to ſuffer, and be annihilated, to perfect in his Perſon the deſigns of his eternal Father, by dying on the Croſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then ſhe abſolutely forſakes her ſelf, to give her ſelf up wholly to the Maxims and Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, uniting and conforming her ſelf, as much as may be, to his ſtates; and her thoughts are far different from others ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And this is not to be wondred at, ſeeing St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays of Chriſtians, that they are <hi>Gens ſancta, Genus electum, regale Sacerdotium;</hi> a holy Nation, a choſen People, a royal Prieſthood, to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57606:54"/> offer to God Sacrifices of good Odour; which is by crucifying themſelves with Jeſus Chriſt, who is a continual Sacrifice. O the ſublime ſtate of a Soul in this ſupreme degree of a ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural life! Alas! the ſentiments of Nature do too much take up our hearts, ſo that thoſe of a ſupernatural life have little or no place in them. What a miſery is this!</p>

                  <p>WE without cauſe eſteem our ſelves ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, if we march not ſtreight without reſerve by the ways of Jeſus Chriſt, or pretend to any thing on Earth then to be conformable to him. This does not conſiſt in ſole ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for we can never do it better, than when the occaſions of abjection and contempt preſent themſelves, to embrace them heartily, as the moſt neceſſary means to make us conformable to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>God the Father cannot praedeſtinate us to be conform to the Image of his Son, but he muſt prepare for us from all Eternity many occaſions of contempt and abjection, which time brings forth. Our fidelity lies in complying with theſe occaſions, to follow Jeſus without reſerve, by his Light and Power. I will tell you how it muſt be done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We ought before all things to have an eye to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus abject and deſpiſed, repoſe our ſelves in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,</hi>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:57606:54"/> abide there with delight, and then make upon our ſelves ſome ſhort and ſharp reflections. Reflections that may form in us the Image of Jeſus Chriſt, without any great trouble to our ſelves. Theſe, when done to the purpoſe, are as ſo many powerful Thunderbolts to beat down our natural inclinations, and deſtroy the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims of human Prudence, according to which we commonly ſquare our actions. Such Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions breath into us a ſupernatural wiſdom, which gives us a reliſh of the proceedings of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt crucified,</hi> ſo little known by world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps it would be better to regard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the infinite beauty of Jeſus in the ſtate of his abjections, without making any reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on our ſelves, or buſying our ſelves with our own miſeries; conſidering only the example of Jeſus expos'd to our view, and the power we receive from his grace to follow him. It is enough, if he vouchſafe to caſt a glance of his Divine rays on our natural repugnances, to quell and conquer them. O my Jeſus! I will regard you in your humiliations, and then you will look propitiouſly upon me, and that is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. O Jeſus, annihilated in your ſufferings! make me, as it were, loſt in my ſelf, by ſuffering with you, that I may be abſorpt in you, and by you in God.</p>
                  <p>Shall the men of this world be more provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent than the children of Light? What? ſhall they have a care of their affairs, and I neglect my buſineſs? I will enrich my ſelf, as well as they, with my own ruins; and from my humiliations
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57606:55"/> I will draw great aids and ſuccours, to follow Jeſus; for my reſolution is to march after him abſolutely, without reſerve.</p>
                  <p>To do any great matters in the ways of the world, we muſt have much Wealth, many Friends, and good ſucceſs. To do great matters in the ways of God, it will ſuffice to be poor and deſpicable, to have Enemies, and ill ſucceſſes: For the more a Soul ſuffers, the more ſhe does great matters in God's ſervice; the more ſhe is deprived of the Creatures, the more is ſhe enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with the Creator. Therefore ſhe muſt work as hard for poverty of Spirit and Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, as worldly men do labour to enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves according to Nature, and muſt employ all means and Motives to this effect. I will ſet down ſome of them,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>'Tis a good Motive, or means, to renounce all Creatures, and our ſelves, by a ſpirit of denudation; ſaying with great fervour and affection,</hi> Away Creatures; get hence from me, and leave a place in my heart for God alone</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>'Tis a good Motive, to do this by a spirit of Poverty; for it is not poſſible to follow Jeſus poor and abject, unleſs in due circumſtances we be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to leave all things for Jeſus ſake, and become poor to follow him. Let us therefore be content to quit all things joyfully, and be glad to have nothing, to poſſeſs God himſelf alone.</hi>

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57606:56"/> they make no ſtrong impreſſion in her; and by conſequence, being become leſs ſenſible, ſhe is not eaſily diverted from the ſupernatural Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of her love.</p>
                  <p>Yea, ſuch a Soul improves hindrances and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements to her greater recollection and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Divine Love; becauſe in this ſtate ſhe is diſ-engag'd from the Creature, and ſo freed from fear of miſeries, which ſhe can chearfully embrace, as the occaſions of her happineſs; whereby ſhe enters into a perfect liberty, and great purity of Virtue.</p>
                  <p>I could never well underſtand what that is, which is called <hi>Purity of Virtue;</hi> but now I ſee 'tis the ſtate of a ſupernatural life, wherein the Soul lives no more in her ſelf, and of her ſelf, and for her ſelf; but in God, and of God, and for God; being wholly ſeparated from the Creatures, and united to God. Alas! how is this poor Soul afflicted to do things ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her ſelf, in this high condition! For often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhe muſt act according to her natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and the dictates of pure reaſon; which affords her matter of ſighs and langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhings after her Beloved.</p>
                  <p>This is that which kindles in her breaſt an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent deſire to be diſſolved, and leave this earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Tabernacle; wherein by the common miſery of mankind, ſhe lives a life diſpleaſing to her ſelf; for being not wholly for God, as ſhe deſires, it ſeems to her a kind of death. And ſeeing ſhe cannot continually live this ſupernatural life without viciſſitudes, it is, as it were, a death unto her. A Death unknown, to ſenſual men,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57606:56"/> but ſuch that are ſpiritual are very ſenſible there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. O Jeſus! deliver me from this life of mortality, ſeeing here I cannot live your life of purity, in compariſon of which all other lives are but death and corruption.</p>
                  <p>To ſee ſo clearly the excellencies of a life ſo lovely, and not to be able to live but little of it, conſidering my frailty, makes me reſent my miſery, and acknowledge, dear Jeſus, how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary your Grace is for me. O how great is the dependence which my Soul hath on your mercy! 'tis ſo mighty and eſſential depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that words cannot ſufficiently expreſs it. However, this comforts me herein, that it gives you all the Glory of the Interiour beauty in the Soul; which is a work more magnifies your Power, Bounty and Wiſdom, than the whole outward work of the Creation. Your greateſt wonders, dear Saviour, are ſecret and hidden.</p>
                  <p>A Soul that lives this ſupernatural life above her inclinations, does more ſet forth the great power of God, than to elevate the Heavens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Earth; for this is as miraculous, as to elevate the Earth above the Heavens. This makes me, O my God, deſire to live this bleſſed life, that I may thereby bring greater Glory to your Name. Aſſiſt me powerfully with your Grace; for if I be once left to my ſelf, I ſhall relapſe into my natural weakneſs, which is but a meer Nothing and Infirmity.</p>
                  <p>Some trouble themſelves too much in philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophiſing on this ſpiritual life, which is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; it being enough to ſay, <hi>The Spirit of Jeſus muſt be the Spirit of my Interiour; 'tis He by</hi>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:57606:57"/> 
                     <hi>whom I muſt live this life, and act accordingly:</hi> and ſo free our ſelves from other conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which may hinder our liberty to follow this light; and fall faithfully to practice, on the occaſions of Croſſes, Contempts, and Diſgraces which happen to us in this life.</p>
                  <p>I ought daily to endeavour after purity, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I cannot attain the higheſt practice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the courſe of my life, wherein God has placed me, will not permit it, nor does exact of me to attempt of my ſelf the grand effects of purity, leſt I ſhould be diſcourag'd by failing in the enterprize. This is only the perfection of the greateſt Saints, and herein we muſt give our ſelves up to the conduct of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, who being infinitely wiſe, we need not fear having him for our Leader.</p>
                  <p>But, as we ought not to be too rigorous, ſo we muſt not be too faint-hearted in the ways of perfection, but apply our ſelves with love and reſolution to all occaſions, by ſuffering peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, and with contentation, whatever injuries we may receive from others, in ſeeking too much their own intereſt.</p>
                  <p>All ſufferings are to be entertain'd with love, but eſpecially what we ſuffer by Injuſtice. For is not this that which the Son of God hath done principally upon Earth, by ſuffering innocently? Do not therefore ſay, <hi>I would ſuffer this injury, if he that does it, had the leaſt reaſon for it:</hi> for this proceeds from ſelf-love and paſſion. It may well be, that he has no reaſon to do you this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, but Divine Reaſon and the ſpirit of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity teach you to bear it patiently? 'Tis
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57606:57"/> good to ſuffer thus, and in this to imitate Jeſus; is pleaſing to him.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing this exerciſe of the ſupernatural life does bring with it a univerſal Peace; and this Peace cannot be preſerved, without ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring contentedly all injuries whatſoever, this excellent life does teach us holy Patience. Now, this Patience preſerves this Peace, and this Peace brings with it an admirable Liberty, and Reſolution to mind principally the <hi>One thing neceſsary;</hi> which is, <hi>to give up our ſelves to God and his direction.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>I Have a great reſentment of joy and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, to ſee my ſelf a Member of Chriſt's Church, and in the number of the Faithful. I have a ſenſible taſte of this happineſs, which is incomparable. O my God! what ſhall I return unto you, for having prevented me with this ſignal mercy? why have you choſen me out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſo many thouſands? Alas! this is the exceſs of your ſole bounty to me. To be a Child of the Church, O what a happineſs is this? 'Tis of more worth than to be Monarch of the whole world. The Church is <hi>the Congregation of the Faithful;</hi> that is, of thoſe who believe and confeſs Jeſus Chriſt, and have no other Maxims nor Sentiments than his. O my Soul! let us then
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57606:58"/> live as becomes our Profeſſion, that Jeſusmay live in us, according to his holy will and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
                  <p>To be a Member of Chriſt's Church, is to be a perſon who ought to have an affection for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations and croſſes; to be well content not to thrive in the world, and to advance in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue by opprobrious uſage and contradictions. What a miſery is it, to ſee us live ſo little in the exerciſe of Chriſtianity! We account it an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be in authority, to be well deſcended, to have a generous ſpirit; but to be a Chriſtian, we are affraid to own it by our actions. O the beauty that adorns our Chriſtian Profeſſion! How wonderful is it, and yet how little eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by us! I ſhall be very honourable and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to keep that with me, when other things are gone and vaniſh'd.</p>
                  <p>O how amiable are the Maxims of a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural life! in what an excellent order do they put all things! They give to every one what is their due; to God all Honour and Glory, and to me a wretched ſinner Contempt and Confuſion. For I ought to conſider my ſelf as a centre of all miſeries and deſerved puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>God is the Centre and Object of all the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Men and Angels; Glory is his juſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, but to me belongs confuſion. If I ſhould be beaten diſgracefully, I ought to take it with contentation, to ſee Juſtice ſo well done to me on this occaſion. And if I was truly animated with the ſpirit of Chriſtianity, I ought as much deſire to be humbled, as worldings thirſt after Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, Praiſes and Preferments.</p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:57606:58"/>
                  <p>'Tis a ſupernatural diſorder, not to love Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minies, and not to endeavour the deſtruction of our corrupted Nature. Jeſus hath built his <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Body</hi> on the ruins of our <hi>Natural Body:</hi> and we cannot form in us the ſame life of Jeſus. without the ruin of ours; that is to ſay, our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural life, according to our depraved inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Poverty, Pains Contempts, your dear Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, good Jeſus, make ſometimes my heart ake; and then again they refreſh me, breathing forth ſuch ſweet Perfumes as chear my ſpirits. A Perfume that purifies and calms my Soul into a fit temper to converſe with you. I will now wonder no more that your Spouſes run after you in the Odour of your Perfumes. A Perfume that doth ſtrengthen me to accompliſh the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires I have to be conformable to you. My heart dilates it ſelf with hope to ſee that happy day in this life, when I ſhall be free from all mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of Creatures, and have ſome participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the poverty and abjections of Jeſus cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.</p>
                  <p>We cannot live here without ſome Director or other; for either the Humanity of <hi>Jeſus</hi> will direct us, or the Humanity of <hi>Adam</hi> will go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern us. If we live the life of Chriſtianity, the <hi>Firſt</hi> will conduct us, and impart to us ſuch directions as his holy Soul receiv'd from the Divinity, which are all for the Croſs and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations. If we love only a human life, the <hi>Other</hi> will guide us in the ways of ſelf-love.</p>
                  <p>'Tis as great a miracle for a Soul to live a ſupernatural life, as for a ſtone to elevate it ſelf
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57606:59"/> into the air: becauſe the corruption of ſin hath made the Soul ſo heavy, that of her ſelf ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but tend downward to ſin and miſery. This is that which magnifies the power of Grace in us. So that it is a prodigious vanity to boaſt of our good actions, when being done by the ſupernatural power of Grace, they are not the fruits of human Nature.</p>
                  <p>If a Soul loſes the ſight of the light of Faith, ſhe will ſoon loſe her ſelf in the Miſt of ſelf-love. If ſhe does not live in a continual mortification by curbing her natural appetites, ſhe muſt needs fall into ſuperfluities and imperfections.</p>
                  <p>The ſweetneſs and joy that a Soul receives from auſterities, croſſes, poverty, denudation of Creatures, makes her ſpiritual, peaceful, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and affords her ſolid content and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The content and delights ſhe receives from ſenſual pleaſures, though lawful, as Meat and Drink, temporal ſucceſſes, Reputation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> make her carnal, and afford her but a falſe peace and vain joy: and inſtead of elevating her to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, do more or leſs depreſs her to ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>WHen the beams of the light of Faith are darted into a Soul, they diſcover to her, that there's nothing true indeed but the verities of Chriſtianity, which Jeſus came from Heaven to teach us, and all the reſt but deceit and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. O what happineſs is it for a Soul to be thus irradiated. Then ſhe begins to know how ſhe hath been enveloped with darkneſs, and dwelt in obſcurity. O what joys do now refreſh her! How rich and glorious is ſhe in perceiving that what ſhe thought to be true Riches, Glory, and Joy, is falſe and counterfeited, and in reality but poverty, infamy and ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>Theſe heavenly Illuſtrations do open her eyes to ſee perfectly the vanities of this world, which now ſhe values not; but Jeſus is her only joy, her life and verity. Whatſoever is not Chriſtian, (that is to ſay, according to the Maxims of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity) ſhe eſteems now as folly, death, and perdition: and what to the world and the fleſh is folly, death, and perdition, ſhe accounts to be wiſdom, life, and the greateſt gain. O when the rays of this light do pierce a Soul, how on a ſudden becomes ſhe knowing, content, and elevated!</p>
                  <p>'Tis hardly credible how much ſuch a Soul is alienated from her ſelf, and whatſoever is
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57606:60"/> not God. She ſees ſo much wiſdom in the folly of Saints, and ſo much beauty in their miſeries, that all the allurements of the world cannot win her affections. For having been taken up with the ſuper-eminent knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhe cannot underſtand why ſhe ſhould dread croſſes &amp; mortifications; nor how 'tis poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for men to apply themſelves ſo much to the affairs of the world, and ſo little to the concerns of Eternity. Carnal prudence believes theſe Maxims to be <hi>Chimaera's,</hi> but in reality they are ſolid <hi>Verities.</hi> She thinks the contrary Maxims to be <hi>Truths,</hi> which in effect are but meer <hi>Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> and <hi>Vanities.</hi> What more convincing evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence can be given hereof, than the example of the Son of God?</p>
                  <p>The ſacred Humanity of Jeſus entred into the higheſt and moſt eminent alliance with God that ever was, or can be, by being united hypoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to the Divinity: And ſo being united to an infinite Verity, without doubt by this alliance entred into the poſſeſſion of all real good. But what was the conſequence of this alliance? The greateſt humiliation that ever was. What profit arrived to Jeſus Chriſt thereby? He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the moſt abject, perſecuted deſpiſed of all Creatures. And why all this? Becauſe being ſo ſtrictly allied to Verity, he could not but have the poſſeſſion of all veritable goods belonging to his mortality; and being ſo intimately uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Divinity, he entred into a ſtrict obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to procure the intereſts of his Father. But the beſt means to repair the Glory of God offended by the pride of ſinners, was humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57606:60"/> ſufferings, annihilation. The ſacred Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity therefore would ſuffer and die, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the injuries done to God, and to purchaſe Souls for him, that might adore and love him to all Eternity.</p>
                  <p>This being conſidered, let men tell me that Honours, Pleaſures, and Riches, are true goods to be deſired; and I will anſwer with the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt <hi>Omnis homo mendax,</hi> that <hi>every man's a Lyar.</hi> I will hold cloſe to the eternal Verity, who hath taught me by his words and example, <hi>That pains, poverty, humiliations, are the true goods that a Christian ought to eſteem and love above all things.</hi> But 'tis a very hard matter to dive into the bottom of this Verity; it muſt be a great and powerful ſupernatural illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can only do it. O how happy is that Soul which ſees ſufficiently to diſern <hi>Verity</hi> from <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A great number of Chriſtian Verities lie hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to us, becauſe we acquieſce in only human appearances, which are vanities, and cloak real truths from our eyes. Jeſus was born in a poor Stable, under the appearance of the Edict of <hi>Augustus Caeſar;</hi> nevertheleſs this was in verity the deſign of the eternal Father hidden under this Edict. The Emperour executed his vanity, and the eternal Father at the ſame time execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the verity of his Divine Decrees.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Herod</hi> made Jeſus flie into <hi>Aegypt;</hi> we judge he did it for fear he ſhould take his Crown from him: And 'twas in effect the eternal Father who crown'd himſelf in bringing about his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Ordinations by ſuch myſterious procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57606:61"/> O how the exerciſe of a Chriſtian Life, and the ſtudy of its myſteries, diſcovers to a Soul admirable Verities! And beſides this all is but vanity.</p>

                  <p>Now, Jeſus led all theſe lives ſo different, to inſtruct Chriſtians, who are his Members, and in them ſhall live to the worlds end; ſo as they may truly ſay with St. <hi>Paul, Vivo ego, jam non ego,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I live; yet not I, but Jeſus who lives in me.</hi> Jeſus hath honoured all theſe ſtates of his life in his Church on Earth: Some hath choſen to honour his ſuffering life, and in a manner it ſeems they are proper for nothing elſe. Others he chooſes to honour his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject life, and in this they are excellent; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceaſing to glorifie highly the abjections of Jeſus Chriſt, by being well-pleaſed with their humiliations for the love of God.

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57606:62"/> and of no repute, but judg'd a charge to Religion, and nothing ſerviceable; and 'tis thought a mighty matter to endure them.</p>
                  <p>O Divine Light of Abjection! deſcend from Heaven, and enlighten poor Souls. What chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges wilt thou make in them? What glory will they return to God? O the blindneſs of ſome who are ſpiritual, not to know how to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the portion that Jeſus gives them, and live the life which he aſſigns them! 'Tis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed in Eternity, that I ſhall live a life of abje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and I will needs live an active life, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for me.</p>
                  <q>O Chriſtian, whoever thou art! it matters not what life thou liveſt, provided thou doſt honour the life of Jeſus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If thou deſireſt nothing but the will of God, any one of his ways will content thee.

                  <p>O the happy ſtate of denudation, which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhes the Angels with admiration! A Soul that has mounted to this point, hath left all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures below her, and can truly ſay with holy <hi>David, Quid mihi eſt in Caelo, aut à te quid volui ſuper Terram? God is the only object of my deſires.</hi> To be plung'd in abjection, is to find God pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57606:62"/> Behold whither a Soul is conducted, whom many think good for nothing. O how the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men are different from the thoughts of God!</p>
                  <p>Let then every one honour God, by the way and life that is proper for them; otherwiſe they will fall into perturbations of ſpirit, and being diſquieted, will become troubleſom to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others.

There are many ſorts of Graces, which we perhaps do not much value, and yet are really to be more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed than Viſions, Rapts, or Revelations. To labour and ſuffer for God, is of greater worth than Extaſies.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a truth well enough known by many, though practis'd but by few, <hi>that a little matter hinders the operation of God's grace in us.</hi> One only ſmall natural inclination unmortified, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to retard our progreſs to perfection.

                  <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>Some Maxims concerning a Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Life.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>O God! what a poor Chriſtian am I in occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of tryal! I have imprinted in me ſome Idaea's and Sentiments of a ſupernatural Life, but when it comes to put them in practice, my timerous Nature ſhrinks, and makes excuſes to ſhun ſufferings: and then the occaſion being over, I have great regreat for not being coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and come to know thereby my little Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and ſmall Perfection. I then ſee that the rule of Perfection is the conformity which we have with Jeſus crucified, poor, and abject. When that is great, our Perfection is great alſo; But that I find I have little or no affective con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with Jeſus crucified.</p>
                  <p>Behold here thoſe lights and directions I have learnt by conference with a holy perſon, and are good for my practice and ſolid eſtabliſhment in a ſupernatural life.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>We muſt accuſtom our body to auſterities, exerciſing it with loving chaſtiſements for our own tranſgreſſions, and the ſins of others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>We can never attain to contemplation, and a perfect love of the Divinity, but by paſſing firſt by Jeſus crucified, poor and abject. We ſee him poor and deſpiſed, attended with few followers, becauſe</hi>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:57606:63"/> 
                     <hi>we refuſe to walk in thoſe rough paths he hath ſet before us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>We muſt have an ardent love for ſolitude and recollection, to the end we may be wholly for God, and correspond faithfully to the inſpirations of his holy Spirit. And although we ought to have a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral indifferency to all ſtates and calls of God, yet 'tis better to incline rather to retirement and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, not meerly to enjoy the ſweetneſs thereof, but that we may not be wanting to co-operate with the Grace of God vouchſaf'd unto us. Holy ſolitude is the region of Divine Communications;</hi> Ducam eam in ſolitudinem, &amp; loquar ad cor ejus, <hi>ſaith God by the Prophet:</hi> I will lead a Soul into ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and ſpeak interiourly to her heart.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>The reaſon why we ſee ſo few, even devout Christians, make progreſs in perfection, is, becauſe they limit the Grace they have received, hindring its enlargement by natural arguments, and human prudence. They ſay,</hi> 'Tis enough for me to do this, or that; I ought not to aſpire to ſo high perfection; thoſe who live in the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo elevated in the ways of God. <hi>Theſe, and ſuch-like excuſes, they make, which hinder the Grace of God from working fully what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we did but conſider the ardent deſire that Jeſus hath to advance Souls in the ways of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love, and how ready he is to beſtow on us new Graces, upon our faithful correſponding with the former; we would be both raviſhed
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57606:64"/> and aſhamed alſo, to be ſo backward in giving our ſelves up to the conduct of God, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires nothing ſo much as that we may love him perfectly, and enjoy him eternally.</p>
                  <p>But as while Jeſus was on Earth, 'tis ſaid of him, <hi>That the world knew him not, and his own received him not:</hi> for ſeeing him born in a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, circumcis'd as a ſinner, live poorly as a Carpenter, perſecuted, accuſed, condemned to die an infamous death on the Croſs; they wou'd not take him for the promiſed Meſſias: ſo as yet he is not well known, and many Chriſtians themſelves do not receive him, nor let his Spirit and Maxims reign in their hearts. Yea, ſome who profeſs the way of perfection, do not, as they ought, eſteem and embrace his humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and abjections: For we too much deſire Honour and Preferment, and too much fear ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and ſuffering.</p>
                  <p>O my Soul! what haſt thou done hitherto, not to have as yet begun this life crucified and annihilated? I confeſs my folly and blindneſs. O my God! make me preſently to ſet upon it, and let not any day paſs over without the happineſs of ſuffering ſomething for your love.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XIV. <hi>What content a Soul receives in a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Life.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>WE have oftentimes no need of any other care than to be faithful to an ordinary way of Devotion, without pretending to what is extraordinary; and we have reaſon to fear that motions now and then to undertake a life of greater perfection, may proceed rather from a ſeeking of our own excellency, than a true deſire of pleaſing God. Among theſe dangers, blindneſs, and obſcurities, we ſtand in great need of the light of Grace, and conduct of ſome holy Perſon, who is able to diſcern what is beſt for us. However, putting our confidence in God, and living in an entire dependence on him, we ſhall find peace and quiet of mind.</p>
                  <p>If we have deſires for any thing, let it be for ſuch things as Jeſus crucified deſired, for they are contrary to our natural inclinations. And though there may poſſibly occur ſome ſelf-ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, yet this is the way of Grace, inaſmuch as the <hi>Found</hi> of our Soul is agreeable to the <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour</hi> of Jeſus, and not to that of <hi>Adam.</hi> Let us have a deſire to be <hi>mortified daily</hi> with good St. <hi>Paul; Mortificamur tota die.</hi> We muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to draw profit from incommodities and ill ſucceſſes, by uſing them for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Grace in us. By this means we ſhall purifie our ſelves, and the Interiour of our Souls
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57606:65"/> will empty it ſelf, and make room for the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt, bringing with him joy and peace unſpeakable.</p>
                  <p>When we ſhall have found out the corruption of our heart, our inability to any good, yea, to the leaſt good thought, as of our ſelves, 'tis not for us to aſpire after the moſt eminent ways; but judging our ſelves unworthy thereof, and content with little our Saviour ſhall pleaſe to give us, we muſt co-operate humbly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with that ſmall portion of Grace we have already, and not grow idle, wiſhing for thoſe eminent Graces, wherewith perhaps our Souls ſhall never be beautified.</p>
                  <p>This is one of the chiefeſt points of humility, to be content with that little portion we have in the ſtate of Grace, and judge our ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of God's favour. 'Tis true, there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing we ought ſo highly eſteem as Grace, and its increaſe in us, and deſire it of God with inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant prayers; but this muſt be with perfect ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his Divine will and pleaſure, that we may not diſturb the peace of our Souls.</p>
                  <p>On one ſide, I behold my extreme miſery, and I find my ſelf ſo depreſſed, that all my natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtrength and endeavours, do what they can to the utmoſt, can never bring me out of my ſelf; On the other ſide, I burn with deſire to be wholly for God, by living a ſupernatural and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life. It is to you, O Divine Spirit, I addreſs my ſighs, the infinite ſource of all Graces; you know I have a longing to live this ſpiritual life; in the exerciſe whereof I ſhall find the true pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Divine Love, by which I ſhall ſatisfie my
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57606:65"/> ardent deſires to be wholly for Jeſus, and ſhall live no more after my natural inclinations, and the Maxims of human Prudence. But I ſee how impoſſible it is for me to attain this, unleſs you vouchſafe to aſſiſt me with your illuminations againſt my darkneſs, with your ſtrength againſt my weakneſs, with your continual ſupplies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my relapſes: For how often, O Divine Spirit, have I begun this ſupernatural life, and fallen from it, conquer'd by my Nature, and worldly temptations! Draw me after you ſo powerfully, and continually, that I may no more return into my ſelf, but may follow your attracts with perſeverance.</p>
                  <p>I will follow you, dear Jeſus, in the ſtates of your mortal life, in annihilations, contempts, poverty and ſufferings. And if I loſe the ſight of you in thoſe obſcurities which ſometimes cloud my Soul, yet let me not loſe courage. Provided I continue in your ways, that is, in the eſteem and love of the true Chriſtian Life, you will not be far from me; it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that Jeſus annihilated and ſuffering ſhould not be near to a Soul ſuffering and anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated.</p>
                  <p>Well then, though we may loſe the ſight of Jeſus, the light we have in Prayer leaving us: though we feel him not by ſenſible influences, yet we are aſſured that he is near us, if we be in his ways by ſelf-denial and a love of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations for his ſake. O how happy is a Soul to be content to follow the annihilations of Jeſus, without the feeling of his perſumes and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes! She does practice the purity of love in
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57606:66"/> this condition: For to be deprived of light and conſolations, which is very harſh to Nature, and ſuffer it contentedly, is one of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent acts of a ſpiritual life, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts chiefly in a perfect reſignation to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as well inwardly as outwardly, when God pleaſes.</p>
                  <p>I am very ſenſible by experience, that there's a vaſt difference between thinking and doing, talking and living this true Chriſtian life. When we meet with no repugnance, we find it not difficult to practice Virtue, whereof the Idaea's are as ſweet, as the Acts are bitter of ſuch as conſiſt in privations and ſufferings. I am in a ſtate wherein I feel repugnances, and am reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thereby to humble my ſelf the more, and keep the peace of my Soul, by an entire confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the ſuccours which the Grace of God will vouchſafe unto me. I conſider that nothing was more ſeeble than the Apoſtles, before <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecost;</hi> They hid themſelves, abandon'd their Maſter in his ſufferings, and <hi>Peter</hi> deny'd him: but after they had received the Holy Ghoſt, he infus'd ſuch ſtrength into their Souls, that they became powerful and couragious to admiration.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THe ſupernatural Life is a continual morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of depraved Nature.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For 'tis certain, Firſt, <hi>That we cannot live this excellent life, but by annihilating our ſenſe and reaſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>That this life is wholly according to the Spirit, which cannot be but the Spirit of God, which inspires the Soul with his influences and ſacred motions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>That the Soul which lives this life muſt be elevated above ſenſe und reaſon, whether it be in Prayer, or the practice of Virtue; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done, but by offering up her ſelf to God as a continual Sacrifice. That though oftentimes w must do things ſenſual, as to eat and drink; yet theſe muſt be done as Grace directs us: And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things according to reaſon, as to love our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Friends; yet this muſt be only in God, and as his Oracles do dictate to us: O life of Grace! how art thou a continual death and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification! Who lives Chriſtianly, lives a Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> Tota vita Chriſtiana, Crux eſt &amp; Marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium: <hi>However, 'tis a joyful Martyrdom, for</hi>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:57606:67"/> 
                     <hi>ſolid joy cannot but make glad the Soul where Grace inhabits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O that this fundamental truth of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did once well ſink into our hearts! The Son of God, and eternal King of Glory, leaves the boſom of his Father, and becomes man, to live and die in infinite humiliations. Jeſus gives us life by his death; He puts us in a ſtate of Grace, by ruining himſelf according to Nature; He purchaſes Eternity for us, by yielding up his temporal life. And the Evangeliſt expreſſing his death, doth on ſet purpoſe uſe theſe words, <hi>Emiſit Spiritum, He ſent forth his Spirit.</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt he ſent it into the hearts of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants, to the end they may learn to live by his Spirit to him who died for them. So ſays St. <hi>Paul, Miſit Deus Spiritum Filii ſui in corda noſtra, ut qui vivunt jam non ſibi vivant, ſed ei qui pro ipſis mortuus eſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What remains then, but that we baniſh our carnal Spirit, which carries us on to ſenſual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, although ſometimes not ſinful? Let us love the Spirit of penance, of ſuffering, of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial, and humiliations. <hi>Gerſon</hi> hath an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſaying: <hi>By how much the more Nature is mortified, by ſo much the more Grace is infuſed.</hi> We muſt often call to mind, that the Grain of Wheat caſt into the Earth, except it die, cannot bring forth fruit. If we do not die to our ſelves and the World, and the Spirit of Nature, we can never become perfect Chriſtians, nor bring forth the fruits of Divine Love. We muſt be as nothing before men, that we may be ſomething
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57606:67"/> in the ſight of God. Why ſhould the Diſciple be above his Maſter? The Spirit of Grace and the Spirit of Nature do continually jar and war one againſt the other. The exerciſe of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life will afford us light to diſcern their different motions; but when diſcerned, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires great courage to be faithful to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Grace. To yield to Nature, weakens and darkens the Soul; to follow Grace, gives life and vigour. It concerns us therefore to take part with God againſt our ſelves. This practice is clear and efficacious to conquer our paſſions, and carry us on to the purity of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, when this light is infus'd into us, after the manifeſtation of God's goodneſs to us.</p>
                  <p>Reaſon may be ſerviceable to conquer our paſſions, but this light muſt give place, when the beams of Grace diſplay their ſplendors. For we ought as much as we can to ſtifle the Maxims of reaſon, that we may become more capable of Divine Illuminations, which elevate us above human reaſon. In a word, as no man can come unto the Son, unleſs the Father draw him by preventing Grace: ſo no man can come unto the Father, but by the Son, following his Maxims and Example, and obeying the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Spirit. This is the order and way of Grace, and 'tis in vain for us to look for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a ſpiritual life.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XVI. <hi>The Concluſion, That we ought to apply our ſelves to the practice of a Supernatural Life.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>WE muſt have a ſpecial care, that we place not Perfection amiſs, for this will much retard us in the way of Virtue. Hence it will do well, not to have too great an eſteem of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitive and Myſtick way.</hi> Not but 'tis good, yea, excellent, for a Soul to be ſo eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God's gracious conduct. However, we muſt acknowledge that the unitive way brought to practice, is more excellent and neceſſary, ſeeing this is the Chriſtian life in action; and the other is a myſtick life, conſiſting in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary elevations of the Soul, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful unions with God in Prayer and Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.</p>
                  <p>I obſerve that our bleſſed Saviour ſays, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will be my Diſciple, must take up his Croſs, and follow me.</hi> He does not ſay, that he muſt be elevated in Prayer, but <hi>that he muſt take up his Croſs;</hi> that is, he muſt practice the Maxims of the Goſpel. Happy then are they who are cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified to the world, though they be not elevated in Spirit; and thoſe elevated Souls are but hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in that they are conformable to Jeſus cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and by their unions more diſpoſed to the Croſs and Sufferings. The crucified Life is, as it were, the end of the myſtick life, whoſe illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations and ſweet influences do much conduce to fortifie the Soul to bear the Croſs.</p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:57606:68"/>
                  <p> S. <hi>Tereſa</hi> obſerves, <hi>That one of the beſt ſigns of a Divine Extaſie is, when it works in the Soul an extraordinary deſire of ſuffering; and that a Soul cannot return to her ſelf from ſuch holy communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations with God, but well inſtructed; which must needs be, that the perfection of love conſiſts in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for Jeſus, and not in enjoying him.</hi> Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this life is not of ſo much worth as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; This more than That advances our Glory. Let us not then complain that we have not our part in the myſtick life, ſo that we be but crucified Chriſtians; and let us be content to feel our Spirit in Prayer among Thorns of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridities, coldneſs, and deſolation, as well as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſweet perfumes of a ſenſible Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>We muſt take up our Croſs to follow Chriſt, as well when we ſuffer in Soul as Body. For 'tis the property of a true Chriſtian, to glory in the Croſs of Jeſus Chriſt. But this did extend as well to his Soul, as to his body. The Divine Soul of Jeſus was left without ſenſible influences and ſuccours from the ſuperiour part, and from his Father for ſome time. We muſt love to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to him herein, and reſt there with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation and contentment. Let our affections be more inflamed with the love of her ſufferings here, than of enjoyments. And if we complain of any thing, let it be when we do not ſuffer ſomething for Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>AS ſoon as I awake, I ought to conſider that I am in the boſom of God, for in Him we live, move, and have our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. We live, and are indeed in his preſence, and yet hardly think of him. I am ſurrounded with his Grandeurs, his Mercies, his Riches, his Divine Perfections, and yet am taken up with petty matters. O what blindneſs! what dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is this! I fall from one ſleep into another, my Soul being no more awake by day than by night; my interiour ſenſes being then bound up, as before the exteriour.</p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:57606:70"/>
                  <p> I am like a blind man aſleep, doubly blind, for ſleep takes away his ſight a ſecond time. When he awakes, he ſees not the light of the Sun, nor the beauty of the Univerſe, nor the variety of Creatures that are before him, He walks in the world, but beholds not the different parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; when he is aſleep, his blindneſs increaſes. In like manner, when we ſleep, we are in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found forgetfulneſs of God: But, what is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable, we continue this Oblivion when we are awake, by reaſon we ſeldom think on God and his Perfections, our Souls are ſo wholly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with worldly buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>Alas! how dangerous is this ſleep and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs! We have no excuſe, ſeeing Nature does teach us better manners, <hi>Tempus eſt de ſomno ſurgere;</hi> When the Sun riſes, 'tis time to walk as Children of light. When natural ſleep leaves me, let me not (dear Saviour) loſe my ſelf in the crowd of Creatures, but take up my thoughts with your Perfection, with your Love, with your Mercies, that I may not ſleep all day long, by being unmindful of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                  <p>Dear Jeſus! 'tis not in my power to hinder this ſpiritual drowzyneſs, and my miſery will not permit me to think on you continually: but be pleaſed to watch for me, that I may be converſant with God by your divine and holy Occupations; that I may know him by your knowledge; that I may have an eye to him by your regards; that I may love him by your loves: and by this means I ſhall be ſtrengthened in my weakneſs. If we do not awake with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57606:70"/> Chriſt, we ſleep with the men of this world, who ſleep their ſleep, being wholly taken up with worldly matters. To be awake with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, is to be exerciſed in the operations of this life, to do as he did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and be content to take up our Croſs and ſuffer with him. Pains, ſufferings, reproaches, ought to be dear to us, ſeeing they make us to be awake with Jeſus Chriſt, and live his life, a life of ſufferings. On the contrary, we muſt look on HOnours, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and Worldly advantages, with a ſuſpicious eye, becauſe they are apt to make us forgetful of God.</p>
                  <p>When we ſee with the eye of Faith, that God is every-where, and is the firſt Mover, we take delight therein, and look upon God as the Soul of the world, and our Soul tends to him, as to her Centre, and ſweet repoſe. This repoſe works in her a will to give her ſelf up wholly to his Ordinations, with an entire love. This reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, when 'tis general and real indeed, doth powerfully free her from the love of the world, making her paſſive to the Conduct of God, and his holy Attracts and Inſpirations. What good thoughts God ſends her in the morning, ſhe nouriſhes all day long, making uſe of them on all occaſions, and takes from the hand of God whatever happens, peace or trouble, ſweet or bitter, reſt or labour, becauſe 'tis God's will, who glorifies himſelf by all events. This carries a Soul on to the practice of pure Virtue.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. <hi>The preſence of God in the Soul makes us little value the abſence of the Creatures.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>I Find my Heart and Soul ſo content in that God is inſeparably united to me, that I am hardly ſenſible of the abſence of my deareſt Friends. I know not when I ſhall ſuffer any thing, for all mortifications prove ſweet unto me, by reaſon of the abundant joy the preſence of God affords unto me. God is in me, and I in him, and nothing can ſeparare me from him, becauſe he is always preſent in me by his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity, which is his Eſſence. The thought hereof does ſo affect my heart, that I value not the privation of all Creatures; but rather I get this advantage, in that methinks by their abſence God is more intimately preſent with me. And by how much the more I am elevated above all Creatures, though ſome be holy perſons, and dear to me, by ſo much the more I feel my heart more united to God, as to its Centre, where I find true quiet and repoſe.</p>
                  <p>I take for a ſpecial grace and favour the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment God gives me by his ſacred Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. What have I to do with Creatures, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God is in me, and I in him, ſeeing he is for me, and I for him? O what Riches it is to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs God! But this cannot be without being dead to the world. Bleſſed <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead to the world, and forſaking it, yea,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57606:71"/> her deareſt Brother <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and her beloved Siſter <hi>Martha,</hi> found God preſent in her Soul, and that ſufficed I participate a little the joys of this Saint, in poſſeſſing God after I have ſo happily found him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When a Soul complains of the abſence of any Creature, 'tis a ſign ſhe has not yet found God ſo well as ſhe ought. But may not ſome Creatures be inſtrumental to bring us to God? I grant it. But when we have found him, why don't we then leave off all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to worldly things?</p>
                  <p>Alas! how flat is the guſt that Creatures af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords, after we have taſted of God's ſweetneſs, &amp; 'tis but a torment to us to continue with them! O my God! ſeeing I have found you, I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forſake you. My Soul is ſo preſent with you, that methinks I enjoy you. Separate me more and more from all Creatures, that this ſweet enjoyment may increaſe in my Soul. What need ſhall I then have of converſe with Creatures?</p>
                  <p>'Tis of ſingular profit to conſider how many holy men and women have (as it were) buried themſelves in ſolitudes, flying the ſociety of all Creatures, that they might be wholly taken up with the preſence of God! Saint <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Aegypt</hi> hid her ſelf in a vaſt Deſart, to be far from the ſight and remembrance of the world, that ſhe might only find her God and Creator. O my God! how happy was ſhe by thus finding you, living without the help of any Creature, without Cloaths, and almoſt without any refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. She had no perſon to comfort her, no perſon to complain to of her ſufferings, no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57606:72"/> to take part of her conſolations; ſhe alone was with God alone, in a general deprivation of all Creatures O how this Spirit of ſeparation from all created things is excellent! O how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary is it to a Soul, who deſires to be wholly for God, and enjoy the ſweets of his Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence!</p>
                  <p>But to come to this, we muſt ſuffer much both from our ſelves and others, to the end we may be freed from the love of the world. God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who will be all in all to his Creatures, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes brings us home to himſelf, by great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of afflicting events. This makes the lives of the Servants of God full of continual altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as well in temporal affairs as ſpiritual, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for his greater Glory; ſometimes it goes well, ſometimes ill with them, in their Souls and bodies, by conſtant changes. Theſe viciſſitudes oblige them to love nothing but the <hi>Sovereign Good;</hi> and in this general abandon of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, God is pleas'd to let them feel the ſweets of his Divine preſence; and by this happy experience of God's preſence, they grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of the privation of things deareſt to them, in which before they found Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, thoſe Servants of God with whom we can converſe, are as ſo many Conduit-pipes, by which God conveys ſome ſtreams of living Water; ſo that we learn from them eternal veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and many ſecrets of ſpirituality, with much advantage to our Souls. But theſe are only Pipes, Jeſus Chriſt, God-man, is the true Source and Fountain from whence thoſe Streams flow,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57606:72"/> which we receive from them, or rather by them. 'Tis from the ſplendours of his Divinity we can have a proſpect of his Grandeurs and Perfections. 'Tis from his ſacred Humanity we muſt learn the exerciſes of all Chriſtian Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. When you pleaſe, dear Saviour, you will make a Soul to know the difference that is between the Spring-head, and the Pipes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween drawing the living Water of your Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from your ſelf, and from your Saints; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a view of your Interiour, and the Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Servants. And ſo to loſe the preſence of the holieſt perſons, to enjoy the preſence of God in a more tranſcendent manner, is no loſs, but a gain. To be without the converſe of God's Servants, to have more of their Divine Maſters company, is no prejudice, but an advantage. The pierced ſide of Jeſus Chriſt, is (as it were) a Sacred Mouth, from whence his Heart ſpeaks more divinely to us in dumb Eloquence, than can the Tongues of Saints and Angels.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. <hi>That we can, and ought to conſerve the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, in occaſions of Extrover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>A Soul may be as much ſeparated from Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the midſt of Towns and Cities, as in the Deſarts. Behold how I conceive this may be done: <hi>When God once makes a Soul ſenſible of his Grandeurs, and gives her lively reſentments of his preſence; this Soul thus illuminated, begins to be dead to the world, and regardleſs of it, becauſe the light that brings her to know and taſt God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, makes the Creature diſguſtful to her. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it ſo much the inſufficiency of Creatures that cauſes this diſguſt, as the all-ſufficiency of God, and the lively feeling of his Divine preſence, which may be had as well among the crowd of men, as in the Deſarts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This makes one a Citizen of the whole world; every place is indifferent to ſuch a Soul; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not attach'd to any Creature, God alone is what ſhe deſires, whom ſhe knows is <hi>all in all,</hi> and his preſence alike in every place. When we are ſad for the abſence of any Friend, 'tis for want of light from Heaven, ſeeing our greateſt Friend is continually with us, And indeed 'tis injurious to God preſent in us, to be troubled at the abſence of any Creature, and it is as much as if we ſhould ſay to God, <hi>You alone are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for me.</hi> 'Tis an excellent means to bring
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57606:73"/> us to a denudation of all Creatures, to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly content with their abſence; yea, hardly to think upon them by reaſon of the veneration we have of the grandeurs of God, who being infinitely preſent with us, we cannot voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be taken up with any thing elſe, without ſome ſort of injury to his infinite Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a great Mercy when Divine Providence orders our affairs ſo as to bring us off from vain occupations, ſeeing we can never poſſeſs God fully, unleſs we be dead to worldly things. As long as they flatter us, and go on as we deſire, they take us up too much, and we eaſily forget God: but his amiable Providence has a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ways to make them diſguſtful to us, by loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, by maladies, by falſeneſs of friends, by ill ſucceſs of affairs, by the ſubſtraction of ſenſible favours, and by a diſtaſt and bitterneſs, which at laſt we find in all worldly contentments.</p>
                  <p>We who underſtand not his amiable deſigns, do oftentimes our utmoſt endeavours to ſhun theſe things, as no ſmall miſeries; and yet this is indeed the Paradice of holy Souls, whereby they find God, who is moſt preſent to that heart, where no Creature finds entertainment. And when ſuch a Soul taſts the ſweetneſs of God, ſhe diſguſts the Creatures; and though they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune her, ſhe generouſly contemns them, and 'tis a puniſhment to give any attention to their allurements.</p>
                  <p>When a Soul does not engage her ſelf in worldly affairs, but by the order of God, her Interiour will receive no prejudice; for ſhe is always in a ſtate to return to God, whom in a
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57606:74"/> manner ſhe does not leave in thoſe employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And the ſame light which diſcovers to her the intime preſence of God, makes her ſee alſo the orders of God in reſpect of external affairs, to which ſhe yields a peaceable and ready obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. For ſhe is for doing what God would have her, though ſhe muſt loſe for ſome time that ſweet repoſe which ſhe poſſeſſes by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God. What makes her retire into her internal quiet, is not the quiet it ſelf, nor the ſweetneſs thereof, but the order of God, who is pleas'd to unite a Soul to himſelf by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals, and gives her a guſt by his preſence, that he is her centre and final happineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But when God will have it ſo, ſhe changes alſo her operations, and leaves God in a manner to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with Creatures. She is ſo diſ-engaged, that ſhe willingly moves not but by God's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which carry her whither he pleaſes, either to enjoy him, or do good to others; all is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to her, becauſe ſhe ſeeks nothing but to pleaſe God.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, 'tis true, that a poor Soul ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd of the ſweetneſs of God's preſence, and of the internal peace of this enjoyment, does not without ſome regret return to exteriour Objects, and ſenſual Functions. She then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeaks, nor hears, nor takes refection, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome reluctance; becauſe being ſenſible of this infinite Good preſent with her, and finding nothing in the Creatures but miſery and diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, ſhe cannot well quit this excellent Object, to turn to the deceitful figure of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual things. Her Treaſure being within her,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57606:74"/> all her thoughts and her affections are there alſo.</p>
                  <p>I have ſometimes felt in my ſelf deſires to be blind, deaf, and dumb, to the end I might be more entirely ſeparated from all Creatures, and more intimately united to the Creator preſent in me; experiencing with grief, that my Soul oftentimes forgets this Divine preſence, when ſhe makes ſallies out upon the Creatures by the Gates of my Senſes. Well then, I muſt keep them ſhut, that my Soul being cloiſter'd up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her own walls, may be wholly taken up with God alone.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>That the preſence of God is clearly ſeen in a purified Interiour.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe Idaea of a Looking-glaſs is very perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to explicate this matter. For God makes himſelf ſometimes to be ſeen in the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour of the Soul as in a well-poliſh'd Glaſs, in the ſame manner as the Sun, or rather its figure, is viſible in a Fountain of pure Water. The Soul ſees not the face of God, that is the priviledge of Glory; but ſhe beholds him there more clearly than elſewhere; God painting his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance in her, in the ſame ſort as the Sun ſhews his viſage in pure water.</p>
                  <p>But the purity and peace muſt be very great in the Interiour of ſuch a Soul, to preſent the impreſſion of this preſence: For as the breath
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57606:75"/> darkens the Looking glaſs, in like manner vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary imperfections ſully the purity of the Soul And as the leaſt motion that troubles the Fountain, makes it loſe the Image of the Sun, ſo the extroverſions and ſallies out towards Creatures, makes the Soul loſe the ſight of the Divine preſence in her.</p>
                  <p>When God manifeſts himſelf ſo preſent to a Soul, ſhe muſt regard nothing but him, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhe loſes her happineſs; it being not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to behold the Image of the Sun in the Fountain together with thoſe that paſs by the way, We muſt let them paſs without gazing on them, whatever Friends they be, otherwiſe we ſhall find that our Beloved will veil his face, from whom we our ſelves have turned our eyes. <hi>There is a time to ſpeak, and a time to be ſilent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us therefore in this happy moment ſpeak to no Creature, and give this reverence to the preſence of God in us, as to regard It only, and nothing elſe.</p>
                  <p>It ſometimes happens, that God permits the Devil to ſhew his viſage in his place. This is when the Soul is moleſted with black thoughts, wicked repreſentations, foul temptations, fond imaginations; and then ſhe muſt guard her ſelf with patience in the acknowledgment of her unworthineſs, and confeſs that ſhe deſerves to be continually baniſh'd from God's preſence. But if our fidelity be great in this ſtate of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and interiour diſquiet, it will not be long e'r God ſhew his face, and make fair weather. There be ſome who loved others ſo paſſionately while they were alive, that they go to Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57606:75"/> to procure a ſight of them after death, and are raviſh'd to behold them in their enchanted glaſſes. A Soul paſſionately enamour'd on God, is raviſh'd to behold him, though but for a moment in her Interiour, and fears no Motifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor the loſs of all Creatures, if they do but purifie the glaſs to ſhew God to her.</p>
                  <p>According to the degree of Purity in the Soul, we find the preſence of God in us; and the following Inſtructions, in my judgment, may conduce to purifie the Soul, and preſerve her in Purity.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>An indifference to every condition, to any employ whatſoever, whereby God may be glorified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>To be regular in our Exteriour Actions, not to buſie our ſelves too much, and to do them with great attention.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>To have a great love for Jeſus Chriſt, dying on the Croſs for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>To have a continual recourſe to God for a ſupply of his Grace, with a conſtant dependance on it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>To be dead to the World, and worldly things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:57606:76"/>
                  <p>'Tis ſaid, <hi>That God is in the fond of the Soul, and there is hidden;</hi> ſo as to find him we muſt hide our ſelves there alſo, by recollection and an internal Life, which Spiritual Authors call, <hi>The ſtate of Introverſion.</hi> The night time is moſt conducing to advanee this diſpoſition, when all creatures are in a manner dead to us, making no impreſſion on our Senſes, whereby we better conſerve that reverence we owe to the preſence of God in us. O how many Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verences are we guilty of on this account? We leave him alone, when we perceive he is in the fond of our Soul to receive our homages, and we turn our eyes from his Majeſty, though he regard us. Juſt as if one by ſpecial favour admitted into the Cloſet of his Prince to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with him, ſhould preſently turn his head to look out of the Windows to behold the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers.</p>
                  <p>A Soul that is ſenſible of Gods preſence, is not guilty of ſuch ordinary miſcarriages. The leaſt word or action that tends not to God, is troubleſome to her; becauſe that being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to leave that reſpect ſhe owes to Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, ſhe fears the leaſt irreverences, as death. And ſeeing that all Creatures are nothing to the Creator, ſhe often cries out, <hi>Quis ut Deus? Deus meus &amp; omnia.</hi> Who is like unto God? My God is all in all unto my heart. In this ſtate, the Soul has not only a great reſpect for God, as God, but for Jeſus Chriſt; God and Man, and for his Doctrine and for his Maxims. The privation of all Creatures does reliſh better with her than the poſſeſſion; knowing for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57606:76"/> that to enjoy God by ſuch happy experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is of more worth than the World.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THat Soul has no ſmall obligations to God, who manifeſts his Preſence in her Interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and makes her ſenſible of this bleſſed uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I know very well, that this union is ſo full of ſweetneſs and deſirable, that 'tis of more worth than the enjoyment of all Creatures: But 'tis alſo full of extreme rigour, ſeparating a Soul without any pity from whatſoever na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture loves moſt dearly. She muſt then bid adieu to the moſt innocent Pleaſures, by being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally dead to all things but God, or what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to him. O what a pain is it, not to dare, becauſe God is preſent, to be complacent to our Friends, or be ſerviceable to them with a natural inclination, but only upon a motive of Grace! For ſuch a Soul muſt not follow the order of Nature, as from nature, but as eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Grace.</p>
                  <p>If the World call upon us, let us not regard it, for it will withdraw us from the preſence of God, to pleaſe our ſelves or others by diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements. A Soul attracted to enjoy the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, has another rule. Thoſe who are not thus attracted, nor have this enjoyment, may do well to comply with their neighbours by charitable complacences.</p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:57606:77"/>
                  <p> The Fidelity which a Soul owes to God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, requires of her not to charge her ſelf with affairs but what are neceſſary; and to manage them with the Spirit of indifferency, aiming on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to do Gods will, which ſometimes we meet with as well in ill as good ſucceſſes. She muſt be more taken up with God than thoſe affairs, knowing well no buſineſs is of greater impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, than to conſerve her union with God preſent. It no leſs concerns her to be well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to the Orders of Divine Providence, to be content with Poverty, with Miſeries, with Deſolations, never ſeeking deliverance upon natural motives, but being pleas'd with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and humiliations, to ſay with St. <hi>Paul, Placeo mihi in infirmitatibus, I am well pleas'd with my Infirmities.</hi> Such a Soul will give her ſelf up abſolutely into the hands of God, to let him work her into what form he pleaſes, as ſoft wax, and ſet what Impreſſion he thinks beſt upon her, receiving all with profound humility; and if ſhe be left naked, ſhe reſts contented. O how a Soul ſo dead to all Creatures, is a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Manſion for God to dwell in? 'Tis his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to take there his habitation.</p>
                  <p>O how a Soul that finds God thus preſent with her, is troubled to be obliged to quit the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his preſence! And when this is often, makes life ſomewhat troubleſom, and ſhe cries out: <hi>O my God, the well-beloved of my Soul, when will you deliver me from this burdenſom ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity?</hi> This is the greateſt of miſeries; to be depriv'd of all Creatures is no miſery in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon: But to be depriv'd of you, to enjoy
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57606:77"/> whom I was created, and without whom I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be miſerable, makes me cry out, <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do veniam, &amp; apparebo ante faciem tuam? O when ſhall I come to enjoy your preſence?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It ſeems to me, I am like a Traveller, who ſees a far off a high mountain, and the way before him, but being on foot, he muſt ſweat to get thither. In like manner, I have ſome proſpect of Perfection, and the obligations of a Soul longing after God, but I cannot accompliſh them: However, I have a deſire, and I ſtand in need of an abundance of Grace, to mount to Perfection. <hi>Holy Virgin; Mother of God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede for me, that I may receive a participation of your Graces, to enable and conduct me in the ways of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

A ſtrict tye to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour of Jeſus glorified, does require alſo a ſtrict conjunction to the Interiour of Jeſus Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.

                  <p>PErfection doth not conſiſt in a general free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from Interiour and Exteriour troubles. Hitherto my weakneſs could not comprehend how a Soul at the ſame time might be happy and miſerable. I had ſo little ſtrength, that my ſufferings did ſtifle the enjoyment of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in me; and the ſenſibility of them did eclipſe the other. And becauſe I thought that this enjoyment of God could not be found, but in a Soul exempt from all ſorts of Sufferings, when Sadneſs, or Pains, or Troubles did ſeize upon me; I got free as ſoon as poſſible, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain my former ſtate of enjoyment. But I ſee my error, for now theſe ſufferings ſhall become the means to unite me more ſtrictly to God; I am content with them, and will offer them a ſacrifice to that hidden Majeſty, who is really preſent in my Soul.</p>
                  <p>For I conceive that the Sacred Humanity of Jeſus, Hypoſtatically united to the Word, had God moſt intimately preſent, remaining in this union in a ſtate of enjoyment and ſuffering alſo. As Man he offer'd up to the Divinity a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Sacrifice of his Humiliations, Poverty and Sufferings; and the Divinity imparted to him a wonderful enjoyment of ſweetneſs by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. And in this manner God is yet glorified in a Soul: He beſtows upon her a profound Peace
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57606:78"/> in the Superiour faculties, by being ſenſible of the Divine Preſence: And in the mean time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mortified in the inferiour part, ſhe makes a perpetual homage of Sacrifice to God, by offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up her Suffering to him. A Soul in this ſtate, is an excellent Image of Jeſus, as both Traveller and Comprehenſour.</p>
                  <p>God does not always manifeſt his preſence to a Soul by abundance of Divine Irradiations, but ſometimes by a ſenſible Peacefulneſs, which gently touches the heart, and unites it to God. In this the Intellectual Faculties do nothing but barely eye God, and now and then the heart breaths forth ſome amorous Aſpirations. As, <hi>O what a Happineſs is it to have God preſent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a poſſibility of Separation! What can I deſire more then to have the poſſeſſion of God? O my God, be my Portion, and my Heritage for ever.</hi> Sometimes alſo the Soul receives a certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Grandeurs of God preſent, which works in her Adorations, and Humiliations: Sometimes the Soul is mov'd with ſuch ſenſible touches, that ſhe experimentally finds God preſent in her, whereby ſhe melts into affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons reſpect, and love, and praiſes to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty; and thereupon enjoys a Peace that paſſes our underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Croſſes and Sufferings may bring a Soul in time to a more union with God, though not to the pleaſures of enjoyment. A union ſo much the more excellent, by how much the more 'tis imperceptible to the Soul, who ſeeking her own ſatisfaction, has ſome mixture of ſelf-love in the ſweets of enjoyment, but cannot happen in the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57606:79"/> Crucified union, which joyns the Soul to God, in ſuch a manner as is hardly perceptible.</p>
                  <p>That ſtate is moſt perfect which brings us to the greateſt Interiour Purity; but this cannot take up a manſion in our heart, without an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire death to all Creatures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now in the Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied union, the Soul being only attached to the will of God, and not reflecting on her own ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and ſo taking no ſelf-ſatisfaction from them, ſhe thinks all is loſt, and that ſhe has no part in the love of God, which is the only thing ſhe paſſionately deſires. What great pity is it to love, and not to know it?</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs this Soul that ſeems to her ſelf in ſo ſad a condition, is a delightful Object in the eyes of God, who ſees in her the love only of his intereſts, in that ſhe is content with a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal denudation; and confeſſing ſhe is not worthy of Gods Graces, wherewith ſhe beholds others adorned, and admiring their beauty, perceives not all this while what ſhe is her ſelf. And this ignorance of her own ſtate poſſeſſing her Spirit, by a true ſenſe of her own indignity, ſhe eaſily concludes that ſhe is a miſerable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And 'tis no wonder if diſcouragment and ſadneſs ſet upon a Soul in this diſpoſition, at leaſt to affect the Inferiour part.</p>
                  <p>I clearly ſee, that this union Crucified, does advance us in the participation of the ſtates of Chriſt Suffering, which is the greateſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage a Soul can pretend to in this Life of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, ſeeing this puts us in a condition of moſt expreſſing our love to God. This great Truth, well conſider'd, will wonderfully comfort a
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57606:79"/> Soul that deſires to be conform to the Image of Jeſus Crucified.</p>
                  <p>The Crucified union carries Mortification to the marrow of the Soul, making it die to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is not God, ſeeing that ſhe lives by the privation of all Creatures. But the ſenſible union does nouriſh it ſelf by reflections upon ſuch a ſtate, which will indeed purifie a Soul from worldly affections; however, ſhe will go on but ſlowly to the purity of Perfection, if God be not very merciful unto her.</p>
                  <p>O my God, how ought we to give up our ſelves wholly, though in the dark, to the conduct of your Divine Providence! 'Tis your wiſdom to lead us through Obſcurities, to the end we may deny our own judgment, which is no lover of Mortification. O how this inſenſibility does purifie the operations of the Will, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reliſh in this ſtate of denudation any thing, but only your good pleaſure!</p>
                  <p>The Soul in this Crucified union, has the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to know how tenderly Jeſus Chriſt loved her in his abandonments and humiliations. He makes us to ſuffer this, that we may know the greatneſs of that; and this experimental knowledge diſcovers to us how much Jeſus ſuffer'd in the ſtate of his Humiliations, and puts the Soul in a diſpoſition to follow him in his Humiliations. And ſeeing the greatneſs of the love of Jeſus to us, was moſt manifeſted by his Sufferings for us, ſo our love to him is greateſt by our Sufferings for him.</p>
                  <p>'Tis to be obſerv'd, that the higheſt degree of this Crucified union, is to have no ſight of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57606:80"/> excellency of this ſtate, which once being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, begins to leſſen our Holy Sufferings.</p>

                  <p>I find the Life of Man to be poor and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, we ſee not God unleſs ſurrounded with Clouds. Our true Life conſiſts in a Holy Converſe with God preſent, whereby a Soul enjoys a delightful repoſe, and is fill'd with Peace unſpeakable. And being raviſh'd with ſuch lovely ſweets, does melt into enjoyments which tranſcend infinitely all earthly pleaſures.</p>
                  <p>In this diſpoſition a Soul does not reliſh the affairs of this World. Ordinary Diſcourſes, though never ſo harmleſs, are troubleſome to her. Yea, the occaſions to help our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, though Good and Holy, are not then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient nor pleaſing to her. She is all for to be at the feet of Jeſus with <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> in a perfect repoſe, and let <hi>Martha</hi> go about her buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding, God makes us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that ſometimes we muſt go out from this in time preſence, and undertake Exteriour Actions in the Affairs of his Glory: <hi>Ingredi &amp; egredi, And this is the Life of a Holy Soul.</hi> She goes out by ſecret Orders well known to her ſelf, and walks Peaceably in the purſuance of thoſe Affairs which have immediate relation to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57606:80"/> God. And is content alſo to be extroverted by Secular Affairs, as Goods and Honours; to ſerve our Corporal neceſſities, and help our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. But 'tis God preſent in us that ſets a a Soul on work by his Orders and neceſſary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>We muſt undertake no buſineſs; yea, not good works without a Miſſion; that is, without ſome Interiour Call from God. And therefore it concerns us to have recourſe to him by Prayer, to know his will, leaſt we do what he does not require of us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>When we know that God ſets us on work, we ought to be very faithful in the performance of it. I obſerve that affairs of obligation do not diſtract our Introverſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>We muſt acknowledge our inſufficiency to bring our endeavours to a Happy iſſue. 'Tis the Sun that makes the Plants to grow, to bloſſom and fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and not the Gardiner that ſets and waters them: In like manner, 'tis the Grace of God that makes our endeavours proſperous.</hi> Paul <hi>may plant, and</hi> Apollo <hi>may water, but God gives the increaſe.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:57606:81"/>
                  <p> O my God, when I am in the privation of the ſenſible ſweets of your preſence, and find a dryneſs on my Soul, it ſeems to me not hard to bear it: But when I am raviſh'd with enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be call'd from it to mind other buſineſs, this ſeems to me more difficult and mortifying. We may ſtrive to have the like content in other affairs, but our infirm condition will not ſuffer it; and do what we can, we fall ſhort of the ſweets of ſuch enjoyment. It remains then to make an excellent act of abnegation; and by an amorous reſignation of our will to Gods, make it our contentment to have no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment than Gods good pleaſure, who will not have us to be diſturb'd to want enjoyment.</p>
                  <p>And thus we offer up to God an excellent Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, ſeeing we give to God what is moſt dear and precious to us, by dying to our ſelves, to live to him. I am therefore reſolv'd to fall a working, without troubling my Spirit too much with the Ideas of Affairs, that I may ſtill conſerve an actual endeavour to practice on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers occaſions and maxims of Chriſtianity and Evangelical Councils, by ſelf-denyal and a love of Sufferings for Chriſts ſake. And if I continue in this Spirit of Sacrifice and entire abnegation, it will make me content with that little Service God requires of me, being unworthy, by reaſon of my ſins, to be advanced to greater perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances. He is indeed our Soveraign Lord, and he may be do with his Creatures what he pleaſes.</p>
                  <p>But whatever we undertake, let us have a care to do our works for God with purity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57606:81"/> and in ill ſucceſſes to have a Spirit of reſignation, which may prove to us of more worth than the converſion of Souls.</p>
                  <p>When we are in the heat of our Affairs, it much concerns us not to let them deface in our Soul the incomparable Idea of the Interiour of Jeſus, which is the Copy we muſt endeavour to write after; in imitation whereof, we always find ſufficient matter of glorifying God, which is the only pretention we ought to have both for Time and Eternity. In this Abiſs of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, I find how to behave my ſelf in Prayer, in Action, in Affairs, in Contempts, in Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, in Aridities, in Diſconſolations. And without the Idea of this Divine Interiour, we do but blunder in the way to Perfection, and ſeek our own eſteem and excellency.</p>
                  <p>There are in Spiritual Perſons three ſorts of Purity. 1. <hi>Purity of Conſcience.</hi> 2. <hi>Purity of Virtue.</hi> 3. <hi>Purity of Perfection.</hi> Whoever is careful to avoid ſin, even thoſe that proceed from Frailty, has purity of Conſcience. Thoſe who on all occaſions practice Virtue without a mixture of nature, have Purity of Virtue. And thoſe who being diveſted entirely of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and the creatures, endeavour purely to practice the perfect acts of Virtue, are arrived to the purity of Perfection. By theſe degrees of Purity; we may diſcover the different ſtates of Virtuous Souls.</p>

                  <p>AFter God has manifeſted himſelf to a Soul, making her to ſee that he is all; the Soul enamour'd on this adorable preſence, takes no reſt but in him, finding her ſelf ill at eaſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, who is all in all unto her. O how Powerful is this Divine <hi>Idaea</hi> to withdraw a Soul from all Creatures, that ſhe may be united to her all! How does ſhe happily looſe her ſelf in this great all! <hi>O my God,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>how true is it that you are all, and I am nothing! Dear Lord, what can we do for you? You are all, and have no need of our goods, Of the all of our Souls, how little are you known and beloved!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know not what men intend in not having their thoughts taken up about him who is our all. Where art thou, O my Soul, when thou art not in this all? Without doubt thou art in nothing; for as long as thou art in thy ſelf, or in the Creatures, thou art in the depth of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingneſs. The content I have in that God is all, is more, as it ſeems to me, for him, then my ſelf: For my joy is to know him to be what he is, before I was any thing. O great all, be you for ever what you are; and that you ſhall be our all everlaſtingly, does comfort and raviſh me.</p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:57606:82"/>
                  <p> I ſee that God is not only all, but that all Glory, all Grandeur, all Beatitude is in him; neither loſes he any thing by his communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to his Creatures. He takes infinite Pleaſure to do good to them by his mercy, and no leſs content is he to puniſh them by his Juſtice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they deſerve it, for nothing can diſturb his happineſs.</p>
                  <p>O what Felicity is it to a Soul that loves God purely, to be aſſured that God ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely happy to all Eternity, and that no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of man can alter his Beatitude! Such a Soul is greatly pleaſed to conſider the contentment God takes to make her live, to make her die, to keep her in Health, or in Sickneſs, to ſupply her Corporal neceſſities, and furniſh her Interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our with all Graces. For God draws great Glory to himſelf by all his Creatures. Be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted then, O my Soul, and be not diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, ſeeing that God is always happy. Be not troubled for any thing, ſeeing that every thing which torments thee may bring Glory to God. Do not value any thing but God alone, ſeeing in his preſence the moſt excellent Creatures are as pure nothings. <hi>Tanquam nihilum ante te.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis eaſie and pleaſant for a Soul to value no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the preſence of God, ſhe finds in him her Soveraign good; all her faculties having in him a taſt of her repoſe, their joy, their ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and bleſſedneſs. God has created them for himſelf; he is the only center of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as the Soveraign Verity; he is the ſole center of the Will, as the Soveraign Goodneſs; and the Memory finds in no other Object full
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57606:83"/> contentment. All the ſeveral Truths, and Goodneſſes, and Beauties, and Perfections in the Creatures do but encreaſe her thirſt, God alone can give her ſatisfaction; and this ſhe learns only by experience, This experience is of marvelous efficacy to detach her from all things that is not God, and when once ſhe hath had a reliſh of his ſweets, ſhe will not return to creatures, nor to Exteriour Actions, but with ſubmiſſion to his Will.</p>
                  <p>How is ſuch a Soul crucified in this ſtate, by reaſon of the condition of this Life, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Corporal neceſſities and Worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs! Paſſions, Aridities, and Diſtractions keeping her off from God, will not ſuffer her to taſt and enjoy him, this much afflicts her. I know very well that the love of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and reſignation to Gods will does comfort her, and an indifferency to any ſtate whatſoever keeps her in peace and repoſe. Notwithſtanding this, ſhe is not in her center in ſuch a manner as ſhe ſhall be eternally. She is but tending thither, and ſo being as yet in privation, muſt needs be in a ſuffering condition.</p>
                  <p>Accuſtom thy ſelf, O my Soul, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with God in thy Interiour; quit all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for this Divine Bridegroom will have no Rival, he muſt have all thy heart. His gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur and infinite perfections will not admit of other Lovers. Look upon him often with an eye of Faith, and he will lead thee into his Cloſet to enjoy him in Peace and Silence. O my Soul, it would be happy for thee, if once thou didſt accuſtom thy ſelf to have attention
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57606:83"/> to the Orders of God, manifeſted in thy Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour of his Holy Inſpirations. Thou wouldſt then follow blindfold his Divine conduct, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much ſtanding upon reaſon or humane pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: But give ear to God alone, and follow his motions, without any reflection on ſelf-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. Thou knoweſt that God is all Goodneſs, all Wiſdom, all Power, and this is ſufficient to baniſh all vain ſollicitudes.</p>
                  <p>I ought to live in Peace and Denudation of all Creatures, relying upon God, who alone, ought to be all things to me. I ought to make it my conſolation to live without conſolation, if God will have it ſo: And be content with what por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Grace he is pleas'd to give me. The more we participate of the ſtates of annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus; 'tis better for us. What though we want all things elſe, if God be with us? A Soul that has God in poſſeſſion, cannot value the abſence of other things.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>IF we will ſearch for God as we ought, we muſt not have recourſe to the Creatures, but we ſhall find him in the fond of our Soul, where he reſides in a peculiar manner, raigning, ordaining, and inſtructing us. The Soul by the help of Faith finds him there, as alſo by ſome feelings and experiences, accompanied with ſuch a peace, all the World cann't give her.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57606:84"/> God alone does communicate this Peace to a Soul by his preſence, for his dwelling is in Peace, which is a certain ſatisfaction the Soul receives thereby with full contentment. A Soul that hath found God, hath nothing elſe to do, but to ſubmit and commit her ſelf wholly to God both for the Interiour and Exteriour; and her Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity conſiſts in this perfect abandon and reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; becauſe now being abſorpt in God, ſhe is to live out of her ſelf, and her own will and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts. So as when God does all in a Soul, he does much in a little time; and this is when ſhe is annihilated as to her own ſtrength and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, in a total dependance on the operations of God. In this ſtate ſhe is free and indifferent to all things, and diſingaged from her ſelf and all Creatures, and wholly taken up with God, who works in her what he pleaſes. Her prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal devotion is to have attention to God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and to receive his orders and impreſſions, be it in Prayer, or the practice of Virtues, or other affairs. If buſineſs, or the Creatures, put her out of this ſtate, ſhe preſently has a care to put her ſelf in again, by a perfect ſubmiſſion to Gods will.</p>
                  <p>God thus preſent in us, conducts us by his il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminations and inſtincts, directing us, correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, ſtrengthning us, doing for us what he pleaſes, if we be faithful to his motions. But a Soul yet attach'd to her ſelf, and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, do not underſtand him, nor perceive his directions; for only pure peaceful Souls are ſenſible of Gods acting in them. A Soul that is free, and in poſſeſſion of God, is diverſly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd;
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57606:84"/> ſometimes on God and his Perfections, ſometimes on Jeſus and his Myſteries, or on ſome Chriſtian Verity; ſometimes ſhe is diſcouraged with her defects, and then again comforted and ſtrengthned with the Power of Grace; other times ſhe feels Interiour Sufferings, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards is refreſh'd with the enjoyments; now in fervour of devotion, and then again in aridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Spirit; but always the ſame in depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on God, and ſubmiſſion to his will. We ought therefore ſtill to regard God in us with the eye of Faith, ſuffering our ſelves wholly to be poſſeſs'd by him, giving our ſelves up to him without reſervation, looſing our ſelves in him by a happy forgetfulneſs.</p>
                  <p>God is in his Creatures, and there we may find him; but his preſence in the Interiour of the Soul is in a more ſpecial manner: There is his Holy Temple, where he pleaſes to dwell, and where the Soul may ſee and taſt God with a ſuavity tranſcending all ſenſual delights and Pleaſures. A Soul thus conducted by the light of Faith, and attracted with this Divine ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſeeks to find God in this his Sanctuary, and converſes with him in ſuch a familiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as makes the Angels ſtand in admiration. Now it is when the Soul can make pure Prayer, ſeeing here's nothing but God and the Soul, without the intermedling of any Creature. God working all of himſelf, without repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, or diſcourſe, or ſenſible guſts of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>This ſupreme purity of the Soul being not capable of ſenſible things, the pure Spirit only
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57606:85"/> can poſſeſs it, and God preſent communicates his illuſtrations, irradiations, and all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry motions to effect this pure union. The time ſeems ſhort in this happy and experimental en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God; but the condition of this life affords no other; where we muſt live with peace, patience, humility, and croſſes; leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſome time the ſweets of this pure union for other affairs, to act, and ſuffer, and practiſe Virtue. O thrice happy that Soul, to whom God is pleas'd to vouchſafe this experimental manifeſtation of himſelf, of his goodneſs, and ſweetneſs! O what peace ariſes from thence, what high eſteem, and deſire, and love of God, and his Divine perfections!</p>
                  <p>Let ſuch a Soul be in light, or darkneſs, in peace, or war, elevated or dejected, ſhe is ſtill the ſame, becauſe God's will is hers, and ſhe deſires nothing but what pleaſes him. Her chief care is to give her ſelf up wholly to Gods will in ſo great variety of Interiour ſtates And why ſhould a Soul be concern'd at this variety? For if I purely deſire to pleaſe God; 'twill be all one to me, whether I do it by ſuffering or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying.</p>

                  <p>Though it happen that we fall into troubles, temptations, or ſickneſs, which ſeem to deprive us of the good temper of Soul to attend to our devotions, we ought to abandon our ſelves to the good pleaſure of God, and ſay; <hi>God only, and his holy Will.</hi> If the Idaea of ſome ſtate of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57606:86"/> perfection preſents it ſelf to the underſtanding, if we make ſome reſolutions upon the feelings of an actual favour, we ought the more entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abandon our ſelves to God, and ſay, <hi>I deſire God only, and his holy Will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This abandon makes a Soul peaceable and content, and dead to the World, to which though ſhe may feel ſome motions of affection, yet they are troubleſom, and gain no conſent. In this ſtate ſhe is wholly abſorpt in God, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her repoſe in him alone, and out of him is no contentment. It ſeems to her that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever accidents may happen, they ſhall not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb her quiet, ſhe is grounded in God her Soveraign peace: And though ſhe may feel ſome emotions in the inferiour part, they do not reach the Superiour Faculties.</p>
                  <p>We muſt be perfect as God will have us, not as we will have it; the ways of God are far different from the judgments of men. The World believ'd that King <hi>Lewis</hi> muſt be Sainted by conquering the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> God made him him a Saint indeed, but not by his Victories, but his Captivity; not by his Triumphs but his Sufferings. We intend to Sanctity our ſelves by actions, and God will do it by afflictions. We muſt give our ſelves up to his conduct, abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abandon our ſelves to his Will, and only love his deſigns.</p>
                  <p>When ſhall I be ſo mortified to my own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours as to abandon my ſelf wholly to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence? I muſt follow purely the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of God, love only his good pleaſure, put my confidence in him, and he will have a care
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57606:86"/> of me in ſuch a way as ſhall be beſt to advance his Glory. Doubtleſs 'tis an effect of Grace in us, not to rely on our own Providence, but to depend chiefly on Gods aſſiſtance. We muſt therefore elevate our ſelves above nature, which relies on Creatures, and fears wants, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors ſufferings, that we may put our ſole confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God. <hi>Whoever truſted in him and was confounded?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There be as well Martyrs of Providence, as Martyrs for Faith. They are more hidden, and ſometimes ſuffer little leſs than the other; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing content with all occurrences of Providence, which deprive them of their Goods, or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, or call their Lives in queſtion for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And ſometimes to enjoy God in a more perfect way, they deſpiſe and forſake the accommodations of this life, that they may Sacrifice themſelves to God with the flames of Divine Love in Pious Exerciſes. Or if Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has ſo order'd, that they ſhould be born ſubject to Deſeaſes and Miſeries, they bear them with perfect reſignation.</p>
                  <p>There be alſo Spiritual Martyrs whom Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has order'd to ſuffer much by Interiour pains. O how advantagious is it for ſuch Souls to have an eye to Gods deſigns upon them, and be faithful therein! As for me, the love of Gods will ſhall hereafter be the rule of my actions and undertakings. I will abandon my ſelf and all Creatures, and put my confidence in God alone.</p>
                  <p>If our imperfections diſturb our inward Peace and union with God, we muſt repair it without
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57606:87"/> too much diſquieting our ſelves for our paſs'd faults. Union with God is never without love, and love will blot out our Offences, and bring the Soul to repoſe in her wonted center.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>ONe excellent effect of the Preſence of God in the Soul, is to make us as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of all things, but Gods will. A Soul that is enrich'd with this indifferency, can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire nothing elſe; yea, not Virtues themſelves, except in order to Gods pleaſure. We muſt ſtrictly examine our ſelves concerning this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral diſengagement from Creatures, and not eaſily believe we have it, except on ſeveral oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions we find ſo by experience.</p>
                  <p>Our bleſſed Saviour vouchſafes me extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary attracts to be wholly his. He puts me into a ſtate of wonderful Interiour peace and quiet; ſo that it coſt me little to do Virtuouſly. I aſpire after dear Solitude and holy Poverty. My Health is but feeble, and in probability my Life here cannot be long, and therefore I endeavour to live ſo diſengag'd, as if in effect I was already dead. My dear Jeſus infuſes into my Soul a Spirit of denudation, and I do cheriſh it; that I may live no more in my ſelf, but my conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in this Pilgrimage may be beneath me, and I without any guſt or affection to it.</p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:57606:87"/>
                  <p> So that at preſent I ſuffer not a little to ſee my ſelf ſo far from God amidſt the diſtractions and neceſſities of the body, and other affairs incumbent on me. For when God manifeſts himſelf to a Soul, experimentally taſting his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodneſs, to live here: below is a pain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her. However ſhe continues in great Peace, becauſe in her Interiour ſhe is purely reſign'd to Gods good pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>I am ſo habituated to have an eye to God alone, and not to pleaſe my ſelf, but in him, and to have no joy but for him, that I cannot rejoyce to ſee my ſelf perfect, nor be ſad at my Imperfections. God is my all, his will, his pleaſure, and nothing elſe. All reflections on my ſelf ſeem to fully that Purity, wherewith I ought to love him who is eſſentially good and perfect. I know God is a jealous God, who will admit no Rival in his love; and that with great reaſon, becauſe he is only truly amiable as our Soveraign good. O that he was loved according to his Beauty!</p>
                  <p>My Soul is inflamed with a great deſire to diſengage her ſelf from all Creatures, that I might wholly be buſied about God alone. I ſee clearly that this is my principal concern, and not to meddle with other affairs without ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. For a Soul whom God attracts to a ſublime union with himſelf, muſt cut off abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſuperfluous thoughts, diſcourſes and occupations, or elſe ſhe will be lyable to a thouſand amuſements. For my part, I often ſay to my ſelf; <hi>Come my Soul, let us to our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal work, and let the reſt alone, that does but</hi>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:57606:88"/> 
                     <hi>eſtrange us from our happineſs. We muſt live a life more retired than ordinary, with greater ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and attention to God and Holy Duties.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This life will ſeem a little abject, and will not be ſo pleaſing to many, who are for unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable recreations: But will be amiable to ſuch who are wholly taken up with the exerciſes of Divine love in a beloved retirement. For they have tltogether given themſelves up to the good pleaſure of God, and love nothing but the accompliſhment of his holy will.</p>
                  <p>This perfect abandon is wrought in us by pure love; and this pure love cannot raign in our hearts without a generous mortification to all Creatures, and a freedom from an attach to imperfections. This death doth work but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure of our love to ſufferings, which ſufferings for God wonderfully unites us to him with the bond of Perfection. Purity, love, ſuffering, God, what would we more?</p>
                  <p>If Providence ſo order, I ſhall freely forſake my ſolitude, though moſt dear to me. I will endeavour to die to all things, to apply my ſelf wholly to Gods pleaſure; and ſacrifice my ſelf, and whatever I have to his holy Will. Has he a mind to reduce me to my firſt nothing? If he will have it ſo, I am content: Will he have me in a ſuffering condition? His will be done; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I complain, but have recourſe to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Suffering for me on the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with his good pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>A Soul that loves God and his Will more than the Creature, is content and peaceable in all events, ſeeing Faith aſſures her that the will
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57606:88"/> of God is accompliſh'd therein. She embraces miſeries and afflictions as proper means for her ſanctification, and diſcovers more clearly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the good pleaſure of God then in proſperity. O my Soul, we muſt now give our ſelves to God in good earneſt indeed, by embracing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and poverty, forſaking the vain reſpects of the World and ſenſual delights, to expoſe a Penitent, poor, hidden, abject life, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to worldly men. Methinks hitherto I have had but <hi>Idaeas,</hi> now I deſire to fall to the practice of Perfection, after the example of St. <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> While ſhe was a Princeſs, how did ſhe abhor the life of Worldlings, and what love had ſhe for a poor abject life? O my God, when ſhall I give you the practice of ſo many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent truths, whereof you have given me the knowledge by heavenly illuminations! O my God, ſpeak powerfull to my heart, and make me faithful in my obedience; take from me all other things, and attach me entirely to your good pleaſure.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>A Soul that ſees God preſent with her by the light of Faith, will often times feel in her ſelf the great veneration ſhe has for ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite a Majeſty and Benefactor. She cannot but have a reſpectful regard for all the inſpirations
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57606:89"/> and ſecret advices conducing to perfection, all good deſires which come from God; yea, ſhe has a reverence and love for Croſſes that come from the hand of her Soveraign good. The Soul in this ſtate is peaceable, and may ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a long time.</p>
                  <p>O my Soul, remember this well, and when any thing comes into thy thoughts, which thou believeſt to be an inſpiration, cheriſh it with great reſpect, and be faithful to the deſigns of God upon thee, according to the meaſure of their manifeſtation. O what irreverence wilt thou be guilty of, not to be Faithful in ſuch caſes? Above all, be content to look upon croſſes and humiliations with reſpect and love, and hold thy ſelf happy to be accounted worthy to ſuffer for Chriſts ſake. <hi>Vobis datum est, ut in Jeſum credatis, &amp; pro eo patiamini.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God is pleas'd to manifeſt to me with what diſpoſitions I ought to walk in his preſence and in his ways,; namely, humility, patience, longa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity, ſimplicity and purity. When we find our ſelves in good diſpoſition of heart, humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty makes a Soul to eſteem it highly, be it never ſo ſmall; and thinks her ſelf happy to have it, becauſe ſhe deſerves nothing; yea, is rather worthy of eternal puniſhment. This will free us from ſadneſs and diſcouragements, when we ſee others glittering with greater Graces; and pulls down our pride from exalting our ſelves higher than God will have us to be. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over by patience the Soul is well compoſed, and labours after perfection with courage and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, be the time never ſo long before
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57606:89"/> God beſtow on her the gift of Prayer. By lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganimity the Soul ſuffers and ſupports her ſelf in her defects and imperfections, ſo that ſelf-love ſhall not diſcourage her in her endeavours. Simplicity makes her ſtill to have an eye to God, and to follow his conduct; whereby at length ſhe arrives to Purity.</p>
                  <p>Our chief work muſt be to do Penance with all humility; and if God gives us not the gift of ſublime Prayer and eminent virtues, to abide peaceable in that little we have, and we ſhall find favour in the eyes of God. What we or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily want is a noble generoſity to ſupport croſſes, and ſurmount the contradictions we meet with from nature in the occaſions of Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Theſe difficulties make us timerous and fearful; but we muſt be content to be feeble, that the Power of the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt may be glorified in us. <hi>When I am weak, then am I ſtrong,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul, Virtus in infirmitate perficitur.</hi> This acknowledgment of our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs does wonderfully humble us, and opens our eyes to ſee our own poverty, and the great need we have to relie on the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>I find that God requires of me to be Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in theſe following practices.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt, I muſt be very indifferent to whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it ſhall pleaſe God to do with me; and to be content either with action, or ſuffering, being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent wholly to his good pleaſure. Why therefore ſhould I long after the Graces of others, becauſe great and glorious? 'Tis enough for me to bleſs</hi>
                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:57606:90"/> 
                     <hi>God for them, and be faithful to my own with peace and contentedneſs; ſeeing our happineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in ſerving God in what manner he pleaſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>When I find my ſelf in indiſpoſition of Health, I ought to value it, and not forſake my uſual Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor have recourſe to ſuch refreſhments as ſatisfie ſenſuality: But to take pleaſure for once to make bold with my body, that hath often made bold with my Soul. Notwithſtanding this muſt be done with diſcretion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>I muſt rejoyce at croſſes and difficulties which I meet withall, as affording matter to practice many great virtues, which prepare the Soul for great graces, and make her worthy of great love. What God pleaſes to give oftentimes to his beſt Friends in this life are fair occaſions to ſuffer for Chriſts ſake by a generous renunciation of what the World moſt affects, and nature moſt deſires.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>I ought to be ſtrongly perſwaded that I ſhall be ſo far rich in virtue, as I ſhall be poor in worldly goods; provided I be faithful to the Grace of my vocation, which invites me to be dead to all things but only God, I muſt therefore have a care not to harken to the arguments of humane prudence, which ſtill finds pretenſions enough to ſhun con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts and ſufferings. Our ſenſuality does much retardus in the way to perfection, but humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon more, being more ſubtile and powerful to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade.

                  </head>
                  <p>WE muſt not uſe violence in the practice of a Spiritual Life, by binding our ſelves ſeverely to this or that way, but ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow the motions of Gods Holy Spirit. We muſt row againſt the ſtream of our corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but not ſtrive againſt the wind that comes from Heaven. Work we muſt, but by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods holy Inſpirations, which are ſenſible enough to holy hearts; a Soul accuſtomed to the conduct of God's Spirit, does know his motions, I cannot explicate this as I would, but 'tis an aſſured truth, ſhe knows them by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>I muſt wholly depend on Divine Providence, without any dependance on Creatures, though holy; caſting my ſelf into the arms of God, as an Infant that takes no care but to lye in the Mothers boſome, to ſuck the teat, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted therewith does love her dearly, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our bleſſed Saviour treats me after this manner; for without any ſollicitude of mine to nouriſh my Soul with Spiritual food, or without any ſearching into Books for that end, but only in his Sacred heart, I experience that I want nothing; which ſometimes does ſtrike me with admiration and fear, that I have been negligent to do my duty. But this fear does
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57606:91"/> preſently vaniſh, ſeeing God was pleaſed to provide for me, before I thought on't.</p>
                  <p>This makes me know experimentally, that God will have me wholly depend upon him, without any ſupport from Creatures; for if I ſeek to them, his care diminiſhes, and my Soul falls into indigence, finding little ſuccour from the Creatures ſhe had recourſe to; which makes her ſoon retire to the Paps of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and this ſuffices. A Mother ſometimes has milk in one Pap, and not in the other; if the little Infant will change, he is deceiv'd; but finding little help from the left Pap, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to the right, and now will not quit it, being grown wiſe by experience. My Soul thus finding little help from the creature, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns preſently to the Pap of Providence, and there abides.</p>
                  <p>I fear ſometimes to have too many conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Prayer; but this does ſatisfie me, that God will have me live as an Infant, that ſtands in need of ſuch comforts. He make choice of other Souls for great performances that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard his glory. If an Infant ſhould leave the boſome of his Mother, to do her ſervice, he would fall and hurt himſelf, and do no good. He muſt then let others work, and be content with his Mothers embraces. Wherefore what I have to do, is to ſtick cloſe to God, and let others travel in great affairs, as more grown up in grace, in compariſon of whom a little Infant is nothing but weakneſs.</p>
                  <p>My perfection conſiſts in my fidelity in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect abandon of my ſelf to God; which will
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57606:91"/> increaſe, as I advance in the ways of God and his deſigns. I muſt therefore be in a manner paſſive, and in my thoughts, deſires, actions, diſpoſitions interiour and exteriour depend on the pure conduct of God and his pleaſure. A Soul well illuminated, loves not the diſpoſitions ſhe finds in her ſelf, but God who gave them, and his will is the ſole object of her complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; it being all one to her to be in this or that diſpoſition as beſt pleaſes God, and loving no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than a perfect abandon of her ſelf to his Providence.</p>
                  <p>O dear abandon! Thou art at preſent the object of my love, which by thee is purified, augmented and enflamed; whoſoever poſſeſſes thee does know and taſt the amiable tranſports of great liberty of Spirit. A Soul loſes her ſelf happily in thee, after having loſt all Creatures for the love of abjection, and finds her ſelf no where but in God, being dead to all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides him.</p>
                  <p>O dear abandon! Thou art the diſpoſition of diſpoſitions, and all other do refer to thee. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are they that know thee, being of more worth than all other graces. A Soul in abandon hath a pure regard to God, and is not concern'd but for his Intereſts; yea, deſires not abjection, nor any thing elſe but Gods good pleaſure. Few words cannot explicate the great effects that it works in the Interiour, to eſtabliſh a Soul perfectly in God. 'Tis aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don that makes her inſenſible in all kinds of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, and nothing but the loſs of abandon can afflict her.</p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:57606:92"/>
                  <p> You are admirable, O my God, you are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable in your holy operations and aſſentions that you make in Souls, whom you conduct from light to light by your Divine Providence, which is not known but by experience. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it ſeem'd to me that the grace to love ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection was the higheſt pitch, but now I ſee that abandon mounts the Soul to a more elevated ſtate.</p>
                  <p>O dear abandon! Thou doubtleſs wilt be the ultimate diſpoſition. I deſire nothing but thee and death, as the gate whereby to enter into an eternal abandon. Dear death, how pleaſant and lovely doſt thou ſeem unto me! What al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements do I ſee in thee! Deliver me from my captivity, that I may fully enjoy my well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved. However if thy coming will interrupt my abandon, come not, for thou art nothing in compariſon, and all thy delights will be bitter to me.</p>
                  <p>O dear abandon! Thou art the beloved of my heart, which ardently breaths after thee. But when ſhall I know that I poſſeſs thee perfectly? This ſhall be when the Divine will ſhall raign perfectly in me. For my Soul ſhall be eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in an intire indifferency to all events, and means of perfection, when ſhe ſhall have no other joy then in God, no other content, no other felicity.</p>
                  <p>Our bleſſed Saviour ſayes often to a Soul abandon'd to his will, <hi>Think upon me, and I will think upon thee.</hi> That is to ſay, let thy care be to be loſt in me, and I will take order for thy affairs. Such a Soul does not ſpend much time
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57606:92"/> in the things of this Life, but in the praiſes of God: Her exerciſe being a pure conſideration of Divine Providence, in whoſe arms ſhe quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repoſes her ſelf, fearing nothing but infidelity.</p>

                  <p>SO much as a Soul is faithful to this abandon, ſo much doth ſhe abound with conſolation. For ſhe is content with the ſtate wherein Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has put her, and is well-pleaſed with all God's Ordinations concerning her ſelf, as are moſt for his Glory, and has a tender love for the Decrees of God's will, who from all Eternity has determined to conduct her in this way, which ſhe would not change for one more ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vared, though one ſigh would gain it.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, ſuch a Soul takes much delight in knowing that many Souls are conducted by more excellent ways, whereby God may be more glorified. For ſeeing ſhe deſires purely the Glory of God, ſhe is well-pleaſed that God is glorified by others, and rejoyces at it, ſaying with great reſentment, <hi>Omnis ſpiritus laudet Dominum; Let every ſpirit praiſe our Lord,</hi> every way, every ſtate.</p>
                  <p>This reſentment ſomewhat reſembles that of the Bleſſed in Heaven, where the Angels rejoice more at the Glory which the <hi>Seraphins</hi> render
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57606:93"/> to God, than at their own ſervice.

Thus it ought to be with holy Souls on Earth, who participating of one anothers good, are content with the graces God beſtows upon them, and ſees no good diſpoſitions in themſelves or others, which does not comfort them. O what profound peace is here!</p>
                  <p>There is but little difference to be in the ſtate of bleſſedneſs, or in a perfect abandon to God's good pleaſure, becauſe there is nothing can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict ſuch a Soul, and ſhe can want nothing that contents the heart. Great Saints do not wait for Paradice with impatience, having in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner found it upon Earth, by a perfect abandon to God's good pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>O holy Virgin! how were you content that your Son ſhould aſcend into Heaven without your company? Had not you as much right to follow him, as the holy Fathers detained in <hi>Limbo?</hi> They were his Servants only, but you his Mother alſo, and yet you remain upon Earth to partake of Miſeries, and they mount to Heaven to poſſeſs Joys eternal, and a Crown of Glory. How different is this diſtribution! Your own dear Son, holy Virgin, vouchſafes to go to <hi>Limbo,</hi> to aſſiſt the holy Fathers, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them from thence with him; and you who are ſo near him, who have ſerv'd and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him during his mortal life, even in his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57606:93"/> and Ignominies, now he is full of Glory, leaves you here.</p>
                  <p>And, what I more admire, you amorouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in this abandon, and are content to want his corporal preſence with ſpiritual joy. O what marvels do paſs in your Soul, O admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Mother, which tranſcends our underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding! All that we can diſcover, is, that you are as well content with the privation as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Jeſus; to remain in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> among his Crucifyers, as the company of Angels who ſing his Praiſes, when 'tis the good pleaſure of God, and the Eternal Father has ſo ordained.</p>
                  <p>O my Soul! when ſhalt thou be perfectly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd to God's good pleaſure? Doſt thou find thy ſelf as equally content in privations as enjoyments? When wilt thou be ſatisfied with all events, diſ-engaged wholly from what is not God, and value nothing but his good pleaſure? Seeing that the Mother of God is content to be deprived of the viſible preſence of Jeſus, becauſe he will have it ſo, oughteſt not thou to deſire ſolely the will of God, with an indifferency to all things elſe? If thou might'ſt chooſe, thou ought'ſt rather to embrace Deſolations, than Conſolations; Neglects and Contempts, than Honours and Endearments; ſeeing <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> have moſt loved a ſuffering life.</p>
                  <p>But this perfect abandon, this holy indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency to any ſtate, this union with the good pleaſure of God, is yet a Mine of greater Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. 'Tis the ſublimeſt, pureſt, perfecteſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that can be in the Soul; 'tis of more worth than other diſpoſitions, and they without
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57606:94"/> it are of no value; yea, in ſome ſort are but imperfections. Contemplation, a deſire to be charitable, a will to help our Neighbours in ſpiritual things, are good and holy diſpoſition, however God does not always require theſe of us. When God is pleaſed to leave a Soul in ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, poor and deſolate, ſhe would be unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, if then ſhe ſhould attempt ſuch matters: but union to the good pleaſure of God can never lead us to imperfection, but always elevates us in grace, and therefore ought to be permanent in us.</p>
                  <p>When a Soul has loſt all, ſhe may believe ſhe has loſt nothing, ſo that ſhe loſe not this diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of union with the will of God; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed cannot be loſt, if our hearts be elevated above all earthly things. Such a Soul can ſay truly with ſome great Saints, <hi>Deus meus &amp; om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia; O my God! you are my all, in poſseſſing you I have all things elſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How ignorant are we, in complaining of the loſs of whatever this world affords, ſeeing the loſs of them, if we be not our own Enemies, may make us find a more pure union with God's good pleaſure! For we never advance more in Virtue than in a ſtate of denudation. And if we deſire nothing but the will of God, and are content with that, whatever it be, we can want no diſpoſition to perfection.</p>
                  <p>Every ſtate, every gracious diſpoſition hath its proper worth, they are good and pleaſing, and ought to be valued, though ſome have more excellency in themſelves than others. But we muſt be content with thoſe God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57606:94"/> to vouchſafe us, in peace, ſubmiſſion, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and indifferency to every ſtate, repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our ſelves in the will of God, as in our center.

                  <p>I Never yet have well underſtood this verity ſo often repeated; <hi>Not one hair of your head ſhall fall to the ground without the will of your Heavenly Father.</hi> The clear and full under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of which will make a Soul happy on earth, and the croſſes which before did afflict her Spirit, will be a joy unto her, and cordial comfort: For then ſhe taſts the wonderful ſweetneſs contain'd in the order of God to bring her to Happineſs; ſo that <hi>Paradice</hi> without this order would be as a hell unto her, and to be in a ſuffering condition with this order will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>Paradice.</hi> The order of God is all in all unto her, and without it all things are as nothing, ſeeing ſhe's only content with the will of God.</p>
                  <p>The Soul that truly underſtands this Truth, lives always well pleas'd in the changes of this Life, obſerving therein the order of Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, wherewith ſhe is well ſatisfied, and reſolv'd to be indifferent to every condition. If
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57606:95"/> we be not content with a low vocation, as well as with great Graces, it proceeds from intereſt and ſelf-love. Great Saints of God, your ways are high and ſublime, and mine are low and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary; in which, however I live well pleas'd without aſpiring after your elevations, becauſe I taſte a ſweetneſs in Gods order that contents my heart.</p>
                  <p>To abide in interiour peace and tranquility with ſubmiſſion to the Orders of God, by a ſtrong union with his good pleaſure in all things, is not the work of a day, we muſt fight cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly many years with all ſorts of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, before we can gain ſo great a victory. In my judgment, there's nothing more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than to leave the order of God, and to aim at greater things than he will have us. But a Soul content with Gods good pleaſure is well pleas'd with any ſtate, wherein is no Sin, nor beloved Imperfections. But our Pride is the ſource of a thouſand diſturbances, and we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually trouble our ſelves, if we will aim at too high a perfection, or run too faſt to that which God diſcovers to us by light from Heaven.</p>
                  <p>A pure Soul muſt deſire nothing but the pure ſatisfaction of God, and not her own intereſt, though ſhe find in her ſelf much imperfection. Jeſus Chriſt, to whom ſhe has abſolutely given her ſelf ſuch as ſhe is, is all perfection; this is enough for her, ſhe will find in him her repoſe, her tranquility, her beatitude, without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling her ſelf too much with her defects and failings. I know not how it comes to paſs, but I am content and imperfect both together, and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57606:95"/> yet my imperfections do not pleaſe me; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Grace of God ſhall they diſquiet me. I do not ſeek for the object of my content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in my ſelf, but in my God and Saviour, the only love and center of my Soul.</p>

                  <p>THe ſolid foundations of a Spiritual Life are Mortifications, pure Virtue, to ſhun ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of buſineſs, though never ſo good, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with Holy Perſons; but above all, Prayer and the love of Solitude, which affords more liberty to attend to the one thing neceſſary. The Soul that loves, cannot but ſuffer at the abſence of her Beloved; and therefore love ſets her to Prayer, to make him preſent. And the better to converſe with God, and entertain him with amorous diſcourſes, ſhe applyes her ſelf ſometimes to the Being of God, ſometimes to this or that Divine Perfection, conſidering him as the Being of Beings, who only is of himſelf, and before whom the whole Creation is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Sometimes her Meditations preſent him to her all-powerful, with his only word creating and conſerving all things: And then again ſhe conſiders him as infinitely wiſe, ordering all things by his wonderful Providence: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as infinitely merciful and patient, bearing with our manifold ſins and provocations: And then again as infinitely loving and amorous of our Souls in a manner unſpeakable. Sometimes
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57606:96"/> as infinitely juſt, hating iniquity with an impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable averſion, not ſparing his only Son, being a Sacrifice for ſin: Laſtly as infinitely good and merciful, pardoning our innumerable ſins and tranſgreſſions. Each day of the Week may take up one of theſe conſiderations in mental Prayer, if God do not ſuggeſt to the Soul ſome other matter of Meditation.</p>

He vouchſafes to dwell in our hearts, and our hearts run after Creatures to reſt in them, that is, in nothing; for the Being of all things is nothing elſe in reſpect of God but as ſhadows about us. What takes up the greateſt part of the World, does conſiſt but in imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as Honour, Dignity, Praiſes, Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo much beloved and admired. There be other things have a Being to our Senſes, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and palpable, yet but corporeal and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, to day here, and gone to morrow; however poor Creatures as we are, we ſet our hearts upon them, as if they were eternal. There are other things whoſe Being is more perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and elevated, above ſenſe, as univerſal Verities, which conſiſt in the underſtanding, however not eternal nor immenſe, nor without
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57606:96"/> defect. O my God, I elevate my ſelf, as I am able, to find you, and I diſcover that your Being depends not upon imagination, or ſenſe, or reaſon, but you are above all this, Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible.</p>
                     <p>O Eternal Being! You never had beginning, nor ever ſhall have end. O infinite Being! You are nothing of what we ſee, or know here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; You are an Infinity to whom nothing is wanting, to whom nothing can be added, from whom nothing can be taken away; Your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is Infinite. O immenſe Being! You fill all things without extenſion, without quantity, without parts or compoſition; 'tis You alone in whom is the eternal ſource of Life and Being. When I ſearch for you, if I go out of your ſelf what do I find but privation and nothing? O my God, what damage, what annihilation is it, when we fall into ſin or imperfection? For this is to go out of our Being, to plunge our ſelves in the Abiſs of nothingneſs. <hi>Ad nihilum redactus ſum.</hi>

'Tis by this Power the Immenſe Machine of the World is upheld upon vaſt ſpaces of nothing; 'tis by It the Heaven and Stars obſerve their motions without deficiency, the Elements and Plants, and Animals are conſtant in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions.

In a word, ſo great is this Power, that in an inſtant it could by one ſilent word produce a thouſand new Worlds

                     <p>O my Soul, let us conſider that we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the hands of an Omnipotent God.

Who can pluck us out of our Heavenly Fathers hands? <hi>If God be for us, who can be againſt us?</hi> This is our hope, this our comfort.</p>
                     <p>O my God, I am very ſenſible what a weak Creature I am, and how Potent are my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; but this does not terrify me, becauſe You, my ſtrength and ſupporter, are Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, in whom only I put my truſt. <hi>Omnia poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum in eo qui me comfortat, I can do all things,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us, <hi>through Chriſt ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning me.</hi>

                     <p>O amiable Mercy of our God, into what corner of the World doſt not thou go, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe thy goodneſs? Are there any miſerable Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> who have not taſted the ſweets of comforts? Who ever made his addreſſes to thee,

                  <p>WE ought to have an eſteem of all ſorts of Profeſſions, whereof God is the Author; who though he be but one, doth nevertheleſs afford to his Church different ſtates of living. It concerns us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to think very honourably of them all, and manifeſt as much by our words, but to betake our ſelves only to what God calls us. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of other ways ought not to withdraw us from our proper Vocation. A Soul then may delight her ſelf in beholding the Church as a moſt beautiful Medow, repleniſh'd with great variety of Flowers of ſingular virtue; and ſo taking complacency in all ſtates of Life, to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57606:102"/> apply her ſelf only to that which ſhe has a call from Heaven, and this alſo, becauſe God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it from her.</p>
                  <p>A Solitary retired life is ſo beautiful, and has ſuch charming attractives, that when the Soul has once experience of it, ſhe finds there her Heaven upon earth. Being to take a farewell of one of my Friends; who was returning home, and having parted with him, this thought forthwith ſtrongly ceaz'd my imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Alas, my God! when ſhall I return home to my ſelf, that is, to you? Seeing your goodneſs is more manifeſt in affording me a place in the <hi>Idaeas</hi> of your underſtanding from all eternity, before time gave me an exiſtence among created entities, now I am your Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, let me conſider my ſelf daily as in you, who are my inheritance and everlaſting poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. To be be at home, O my Soul, is not to be with thy ſelf, but with God thy Creator.</p>
                  <p>O how great is the blindneſs of men, not to underſtand that they have no other Country but the Divinity, from whence they proceeded by their Creation! Inconſiderate Creatures, whether are you going? For my part I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home to the Fountain of my Being, my true home who is great, beautiful, admirable, eternal and incomprehenſible. O what joy is it to conſider that my true home is ſuch as he is! Is it poſſible, O my God, that you are the home and center of my Soul? Why do we not readily go out from the clogging crouds of Creatures, where we are in perpetual baniſhment, to return to our home, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57606:102"/> of our Creatour? What can I deſire in Heaven or in Earth beſides you, my portion and Inheritance for ever?</p>
                  <p>Comfort thy ſelf, O my Soul, conſidering that thou ſhalt return to the Divinity, thy glorious home, and in the <hi>interim</hi> reſt content with Jeſus, thy crucified home, and repoſe. O how amiable alſo, how great and admirable is Jeſus crucified! My Soul can find no Peace but by reſting in him, where nature taſts a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs a thouſand times more ſweet than all Worldly delicacies. Without him all other pleaſures are but dreaming fancies. O Jeſus crucified, the World knows not your ſweets, the beauty of your ſufferings is hid from their ſight; they behold you on the <hi>Croſs</hi> with carnal eyes; elſe next to the Divinity they would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover nothing more ſweet and lovely.</p>
                  <p>Do not therefore ſtay me up with Flowers, but with Thorns; do not encompaſs me with Apples, but with Nails, becauſe I languiſh with love. The beauties and ſweets of Jeſus pierce my heart, and I cannot ſuffer more, than to be without ſuffering in the ſight of my ſuffering and crucified Jeſus. But ſome ſay, to ſuffer much is hurtful to us. Alas! do we find it hurtful to us to love much? Wherefore will ye that love crucifying, ſhall be more moderate then love-enjoying, which too often weakens the Soul, and ſometimes wounds us to death? A too great ſolicitude about corporal health, is a ſign we do not take up our abode in the wounds of Jeſus crucified. We are never better then when ſighing under the burden of the <hi>Croſs.</hi>

                  <p> God beholding himſelf, takes infinite delight in his own perfections; out of himſelf he is alike pleaſed, to ſee thoſe Perfections crowned in his Creatures. His mercy does triumph in the Bleſſed Saints and Angels, and his Juſtice in Hell. A Soul introverted in ſolitude with God alone, finds ſweetneſs unſpeakable in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering theſe marvels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> She feels alſo an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive joy to ſee that the travels, and ſighs, and ſufferings, and blood of Jeſus are crowned with a Glory by the Elect on earth, whether it be by ſuffering or enjoying. When they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer a temptation, the blood of Jeſus is crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. When they practiſe heroick acts of Virtue, the blood of Jeſus is crowned. All glory be to him both in Time and Eternity.</p>
                  <p>O Mortals, come and ſee, if there be any beauty, goodneſs and perfection comparable to that of Jeſus, our God and Saviour. O how lovely is he, and yet how little is he beloved? How great, and yet how deſpiſed? How infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in his Perfections, and yet how little known? O the only deſire of my Soul, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your ſelf ſomewhat more clearly to me, that being raviſh'd with your Beauties, I may be ſolely taken up with your Perfections. Shall any creature after this oblige me to regard it? No, my eyes ſhall be fixed on God alone.</p>
                  <p>Farewell then poor Creatures, I am above you; you ſhall never more amuſe me; I leave you to place my thoughts on my Well-beloved. Methinks I feel his powerful attracts, drawing me out of my ſelf, to poſſeſs him alone. My Friends, do not moleſt me any more, leave me
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:57606:103"/> in my ſelf to poſſeſs my God, and admire his Perfections. You may ſerve him by helping o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but leave me to ſerve him in himſelf, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire none but him, nor to be taken up with any thing but him, ſeeing he is pleas'd to let me know it is his pleaſure. Farewell Creatures, farewell Friends, farewell Devotes, farewell World; I am going to God, to unite my ſelf unto him by a conſtant retreat, that ſhall never ſuffer a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>I am reſolv'd on the <hi>Vigil of All Saints</hi> to mount up to Heaven, to congratulate their Happineſs, and beg their Charity; for ſurely they will be very liberal on their general Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, and my Soul hopes for great ſuccours from them in her miſeries. However I will chiefly ſollicit the Bleſſed <hi>Hermits</hi> and Solitary <hi>Monks,</hi> whoſe habitation in this Life was in Deſarts and Monaſteries. I have a call from Heaven to addreſs my ſelf to them, to beg their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, for ſome part of their Spirit of Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, retirement from the World, and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour poverty, which is the true life of Holy Recluſes, being in a profound ſolitude of Soul by a denudation of all Creatures; while their Bodies inhabit the moſt ſecret Deſarts.</p>
                  <p>Great Saints! what do you here upon Earth? You labour not to help others, being far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd from the company of Men; ſo that you ſeem to be but unprofitable ſervants. Alas!
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57606:104"/> how ill do ſenſual men judge of the Interiour of Saints? I tell you theſe are the great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, who in their Deſarts offer up continual Sacrifices to the Grandeurs of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible Majeſty, by profound poverty of Spirit, and annihilation of themſelves: And being in a denudation of all Creatures, their deſires are for God, and him alone. This is the Happy ſtate, this is the Paradice my Soul ſighs after at preſent; to live ſo ſequeſtred from Creatures, as if I were in the Deſarts of <hi>Lybia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Good Jeſus, there's nothing impoſſible to your Grace, grant me this poverty of Spirit; and if Exteriour poverty be neceſſary to poſſeſs this Interiour whereof I ſpeak, make me as poor as <hi>Job;</hi> if my Friends muſt leave me, I will freely part with them, and be content to be forgotten in their affections for ever.</p>
                  <p>O my God, eſtrange me from all Creatures, give me that profound poverty of Spirit, which methinks I underſtand, though I cannot expreſs it. Thus dead to the World, I ſhall enter into the joy of my Saviour, for there's no enjoying of God, without a perfect denudation of all Creatures. But how ſhall I get this Treaſure, who have the dominion of Temporal Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? I muſt either really quit them to gain this Jewel; or poſſeſs them, as if I poſſeſs'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. The examples of the Bleſſed in Heaven afford me both comfort and ſatisfaction. The Saints are rich, for they want nothing, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they are poor in Spirit, becauſe they continually annihilate all the riches of their glory in the preſence of the great God,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57606:104"/> being ready to part with their Felicity, and to be annihilated, if ſuch was the Will of God. In this manner I muſt poſſeſs what I have, being prepared to part with it, when God will have it ſo.</p>
                  <p>I obſerve that for want of Solitude, the Soul does not diſcern the more ſubtile workings of God in her interiour, which afterwards ſhe diſcovers by experience. Theſe are great Graces, but come to no effect for want of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſion and attention. I know well enough that Faith is ſufficient to direct the Soul to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the knowledge and love of her Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; But 'tis true alſo that the God of love has more ſecret and in-time ways, wherewith the Divine Wiſdom works the Soul into a temper, to make her ſenſible of his amorous embraces. O my God, how are you hidden in the fund of our Souls! And you do not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your ſelf to us except in a perfect Solitude; when we are out of the noiſe of Creatures, God and the Soul being alone together.</p>
                  <p>O poor Mortals, how long ſhall your hearts hanker after the things of this World? Turn your ſelves perfectly to God, and ſee and taſte how ſweet he is. Happy are thoſe moments, although but ſhort, wherein we have a taſte of the Divine ſweetneſs, and partake of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his ſenſible preſence. Such a Soul will find in her ſelf a certain averſion and diſguſt of worldly Vanities, a deſire to leave them, a love of Solitude and Silence, to be the more at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to attend to Gods Service; all other things now appearing to her but as droſs and dung,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57606:105"/> and of no value. Speak to ſuch a Soul of worldly affairs, and you ſeem to caſt duſt in her eyes, which hinders her from beholding the beauties of her Beloved; and as ſoon as ſhe can, ſhe clears her eyes, to recover her Happineſs. This inconvenience makes her flee from the World, to preſerve her purity from being ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied with the duſt of Creatures.</p>
                  <p>When we leave our Solitude by the order of God to converſe with men, we find our ſelves better diſpos'd to the practice of Heroick Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, to a perfect contempt of riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, to patience in croſs affairs, to the love of enemies, to an affability, condeſcendance, and fidelity to our Friends: Thus expreſſing in our actions the Image of Jeſus Chriſt, by faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully complying with the occaſions of Virtue. Pure Mortification, pure Virtue, theſe are the delights of a Soul, that hath convers'd with God in a holy retirement, where ſhe hath learn'd to love him purely, and ſuffer for him.</p>

                  <p>I find by experience, that nothing more hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders our Salvation and Holineſs, than to overwhelm our ſelves with multiplicity of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, though lawful, ſo as to looſe thereby the times alotted for Prayer and Mortification, the proper nouriſhment of a Spiritual Life. A gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soul muſt therefore ſo comport her ſelf in
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57606:105"/> converſe and action, as not to engage at all her affections therein; for God alone is the life of her Spirit; without whom ſhe finds her ſelf both poor and miſerable. 'Tis God only makes our Solitude amiable, being a kind of partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Life of God, which conſiſts in knowing and loving. This Solitary life is much endang'red, and ſometimes loſt in a croud of Creatures; nor can the Soul approach to them without ſome ſpiritual detriment. She muſt therefore have a care not to leave her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements, to follow Worldly buſineſs, unleſs it be by ſome inſpiration from God, or obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Superiours. In which caſes if ſhe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to do good to others, it will be no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to her ſelf.</p>
                  <p>You may give them a hearing, who tell you that 'tis not well done thus to retire from the World; for they may ſpeak this out of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but yet without a true knowledge and underſtanding of your way. To diſcern this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, we muſt have a care not to confound ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual maxims, ſome whereof are proper for a Contemplative, others for an Active Life. Theſe are to be put in practice without partiality, for otherwiſe we ſhall much diſorder the ways of God, and diſquiet others. Seeing the Active and Contemplative Life are different, the practice muſt be different likewiſe. The Active requires to ſpend much time to do others good both Spiritually and Corporally; which cannot be done without abilities and poſſeſſions to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the poor. Theſe poſſeſſions cannot be kept without ſome care and trouble; and this care
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:57606:106"/> of Temporals is ſuitable enough to the Active Life: But damagable to the Contemplative; which layes aſide all Temporal Affairs, leaſt they ſhould divert them from their principal employment, which is the actual love of God, and attention to his Divine preſence.</p>
                  <p>The Active Life requires poſſeſſions, to have wherewithall to give to the poor: 'Tis enough for the Contemplative, to have himſelf in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, that he may give himſelf up wholly to God, whereby he poſſeſſes him with great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Thoſe that undertake this Solitary Life of Contemplation muſt expect ſufferings on every ſide; yea, ſome ſpiritual men will account them Sycophants. There's little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of them, becauſe they live a hidden life, and paſs in a manner for unprofitable Perſons. They live unknown, and die in abjection; and living a deſpis'd life, they are eſteemed by too many but as the duſt of the earth. And which is the greateſt croſs of all, if their Directors have not light and judgment in theſe matters, they force them to an Active Life, and ſo bring them off from their way and center, with a continual rack and violence to their Conſcience and Inclinations. The Devil Perſecutes them in their Solitudes, endeavouring to divert them by diſguſts, or by <hi>Idaeas</hi> of great matters they ſhall do by helping others and that they ought to prefer the ſalvation of one only Soul, before all their Prayers and Contemplations.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding all this, they ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue conſtant to the Solitude, to which they have a call from Heaven; unleſs God give them
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:57606:106"/> different Inſpirations, to apply themſelves to an Active Life. Holy <hi>Abraham</hi> did quit his Hermitage upon theſe terms, to ſearch out his debauched Neece, to ſave her Soul. The trueſt Rule for Contemplatives, either to continue, or quit their Solitude, is to obſerve the inſtincts and motions of God in their Interiour, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd by skilfull Directors in thoſe matters.</p>
                  <p>We muſt have a ſpecial care, that in the eager purſuit of the things of God, we do not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw our ſelves from the Divine Order concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning us in a courſe of ſpirituality. Our great efforts muſt be, not to do much, but to pleaſe God: And ſeeing God is pleas'd with a little from us (though all we can do for his glory is always very little; and almoſt nothing) we muſt be content to do little, ſince ſuch is the order of his Providence. Let every one go on in his own way with indifferency, love and fidelity: leaving others Peaceable in theirs, with a great eſteem of the Grace of God in them; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing on our courſe; 'tis no prudence to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the actings of God in us, unleſs to ſuch who are Practitioners in Contemplation.</p>
                  <p>Who has a call to Solitude and Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, muſt free himſelf from Creatures as much as poſſible; ſhun diſcourſes of News, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on Worldly Affairs, unleſs conſtrained by neceſſity or Charity: For a little matter will darken the Soul, and hinder her from being ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated to God by Contemplation. To conclude, believe me, a true Contemplation muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with profound Purity of Virtue, which cannot be attained by a conſtant Mortification
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57606:107"/> of ſenſual nature, which is no ſmall and a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Martyrdom.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>MEthinks for ſome days paſt I have had many inward motions inviting me to Solitude and Contemplation, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding did not reliſh with me, becauſe in ſuch retirements we do little or nothing for the good of others. But we ought to carry our ſelves above ſuch conſiderations, reſolutely following the conduct of God, with a firm adherence to his Orders. In this faithful complyance with Divine Inſpirations, conſiſts the Purity and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of our Souls; it being the principal work, and moſt advantagious means to attain to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and union with God.</p>
                  <p>O my God, I am in a manner good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; you have not endow'd me with great Talents for the good of others: But I muſt needs acknowledge your ſingular mercies to me, in enriching my Soul with Divine love, and continual aſpiring after union with you. Let others do what you have ſet them about, 'tis ſufficient for me, if the ardours of Divine Love inflame my heart. To have inflamed affections for you, is my greateſt work, but to bring my heart to ſuch a temper, it muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like dry wood, being emptyed of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, by a ſeperation from all Creatures. This
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57606:107"/> deſire of inflamed affections puts me upon pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying my heart; and the expectation of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment makes me eager in the practice of Mortification, by embracing Evangelical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and maxims of Chriſtianity. Seeing po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, contempt and croſſes increaſe the flames of Divine Love; they are welcom to me, for I ardently deſire to ſee them ariſe to their high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt elevation.</p>
                  <p>I know a good Religious man, who in his Solitudes is in continual Prayer, not only by the elevation of his Spirit, but by union with God in a wonderful manner. My Soul finds great contentment in his diſcourſe and converſation. In ſickneſs his enjoyment of God is not ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, nor his Peace of Soul ſo ſavorous, though always great. Worldly converſations ſeem but as dreams to him, and when paſt, they did only leave confus'd <hi>Idaeas</hi> in his memory. A bleſſed man doubtleſs while here on earth. And converſing with me in ſimplicity of heart by obedience, he declar'd to me what wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enjoyments God was pleas'd to vouchſafe unto him.</p>
                  <p>He told me, that to attain Purity of Heart, we muſt diveſt our ſelves of all affections to Creatures, and not ſatisfie our natural deſires; which is a great Mortification; when 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual. In ſickneſs we muſt ſtand very much upon our guard, for we eaſily relax, and yield too much to nature. Not to correſpond to a known inſpiration is groſs infidelity, and much retards our advancement in a Spiritual Life. A principal point of Devotion, is by a punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57606:108"/> fidelity to omit no occaſion to practice vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, whether of humility, patience, abjection, or any other. This Contemplative told me, that the choiceſt effect wrought in us by Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations or Viſions, is this punctual fidelity to Gods calls.</p>
                  <p>'Tis an affair will take up the whole Soul, to free her ſelf from any engagement with Creatures, and conquer her own natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, that ſhe may enter into the ſtates of Jeſus crucified, and into his ways with his Spirit, that is, with his intentions and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Let us, O my Soul, in the profound ſilence of our Solitude, often ſay to Jeſus: <hi>O Divine Jeſus, deſpiſed for me, contemptible, poor for me, a poor Creature annihilated for me a meer nothing.</hi> Terms which in ſome ſort expreſs the perfect union that the Soul ought to have with Jeſus Crucified. And this union is the grand occupation of Solitaries.</p>
                  <p>In the Court of Kings, the Cooks and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and other meaner Officers labour more than a Gentleman of the Chamber, who has little to do but to attend his Majeſty, as a Companion rathen then a Servant. A Favourite has yet leſs employ, being admitted into his Prince's Cloſet, to converſe freely with him, and entertain each other with mutual careſſes. In the Houſe of God, they who are appointed moſt for action, are not the greateſt Favourites; thoſe to whom God vouchſaſes extraordinary viſits in Contemplation, labour leſs, and yet are more accepted by him; <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Tis not for us to apply our ſelves too much to Exteriour actions
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57606:108"/> of Charity, but to correſpond to Gods Holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations, if he call us to Solitude, to attend on himſelf alone out of the noiſe of Creatures.</p>
                  <p>Is it not great pity that Temporal affairs ſhould take up the beſt days of our years, and the choiceſt hours of our days, leaving us little time in compariſon to apply our ſelves to the one thing neceſſary, the work of our Eternal Salvation? 'Twould be better for us, if we would allot more time to our Holy retirements, to converſe with God by Prayer and Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, and begin on earth what we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue without end in ever Bleſſed Eternity.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>LEt us not deceive our ſelves in being content to receive the ſeed of Divine Inſpirations, without bringing forth any fruit according to the deſigns of God. If we have a diſcerning Spirit in the ways of Grace, we ſhall ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover that this our only affair, and all the reſt is but amuſement and folly. To nouriſh this Divine Seed in us, we muſt ſhun the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Worldly wiſemen, who are guided only by Carnal Prudence, and ſo being ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the Procedings of Grace, leave in us more or leſs by their Diſcourſe ſome Impreſſion of their ill opinions, which will retard our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement in the ways of God.</p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:57606:109"/>
                  <p> To put the Soul into Solitude, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire from all Creatures, and put our ſelves ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely in the hands of God, to do with us what he pleaſes, and apply our ſelves to him alone with all poſſible endeavours. To be faithful herein, we muſt reſolve to ſuffer much; for we cannot abide Peaceably in this Divine Hermitage without leaving Parents, Friends, Worldly Entertainments, Affairs, and to ſuffer almoſt a continual Perſecution on every ſide. For one tells you, that it is an Hypocritical and unprofitable Life. Another, that ſo much Solitude cannot be good, in that we ought to have ſome Charity for our Neighbour. But let them talk on, every one is to follow his own work, and the will of God, according to their vocation. The beſt and moſt noble imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the World, is to converſe with God, and do that on Earth, which the Saints and Angels do in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>How the Devil perſecutes a Soul in this ſtate under fair pretences? But ſhe muſt ſtop her ears, and quit all to adhere to her Soveraign good, when he vouchſafes to call her to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend on him alone. When God ſays he will lead a Soul into a Solitude, <hi>Ducam eam in Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinem. 'Tis a ſingular Mercy:</hi> For we ſhall find but few in the World prepar'd for the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and reſolv'd to go through all the difficulties of a Life ſo ſupernatural. A Soul that is in ſuch a happy diſpoſition, will live Solitary, not troubling her ſelf with the cryes of others. When God once ſpeaks Powerfully to the heart, 'twill make more impreſſion on us than all the noiſe
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57606:109"/> of the World: It comes into my mind, that to be Faithful to the Call of God, which I have to Solitude, requires of me to ſpend ſix hours a day in Prayer, and to comply therewith, to retire my ſelf about five in the Afternoon, and eat little at night.</p>
                  <p>Methinks alſo I ought to obſerve a general Solitude, not only in relation to my Soul, but to my Interiour and Exteriour Senſes; yea, when I ſhall converſe with my Friends; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her, I conceive this may be done. Sacred Solitude conſiſts in being alone with God, in a vacancy from Creatures, and whatevet is not God. It ſeems to me then, when we diſcourſe of God and his affairs, we make our tongue Solitary, and ſo ſpeak like a Hermit. When we will not give ear to any but Divine Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, our ears turn Hermits. When we will not allow our eyes any Objects, but ſuch as are pleaſing to God, we put them into a Hermitage. The ſame may be ſaid of our Memory, wholly taken up with <hi>Idaeas</hi> of God and his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies: Of our Underſtanding and will, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed only in the knowledge and love of God. If we would often put our Senſes into this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, we ſhould attain great Purity of Virtue.</p>
                  <p>A true Solitare does hardly touch the earth with his Feet, that is, all his ſtay with the Creatures is for pure neceſſity, his Converſation being with God and Heavenly things: I have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations from God to Prayer and Solitude ſo frequent and powerful, that my Soul takes pleaſure in nothing elſe. Methinks God ſpeaks thus to my Soul: <hi>Be thou Faithful to quit all</hi>
                     <pb n="192" facs="tcp:57606:110"/> 
                     <hi>Worldly things, and I will conduct thee into an Interiour Solitude, where no Creatures ſhall hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thee, and I will ſpeak to thy heart,</hi> which ſhall anſwer: <hi>Of what will my Divine Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom ſpeak, except of his Infinite Beauty and Goodneſs?</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>A Solitude, or Retreat of Ten Days upon the Infallible Myſtery of the Sacred Trinity.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>ALthough every one who will ſeriouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himſelf to the great affair of his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, ought to have an affection for Solitude, as the proper School of Virtue; yet 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary from time to time to make ſome more ſevere retreats, by ſeperating our ſelves from all buſineſs and company, that we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God alone, in a more continual Prayer than ordinary. I obſerve that there are divers manners to treat with God in Prayer, and a devout Soul muſt conform her ſelf to the meaſure of Grace beſtowed on her, co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting therewith with all humility and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, whether her Prayer be of higher or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour nature.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, when the Soul by the light of reaſon diſcourſes on the Principles of Faith. The ſecond is, when in converſe with God, ſhe only beholds the proper objects of Faith by a ſimple view and apprehenſion. The third is,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57606:110"/> when a Soul receives Supernatural Illuſtrations in the underſtanding, and extraordinary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Will, to know and love God by the gift of Wiſdom. And this paſſive and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Prayer hath many degrees, of which I have nothing to ſay at preſent. A Soul ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in the operations of Grace, will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know to what ſort of Prayer ſhe has a Call from God, and will betake her ſelf to it with great ſweetneſs, ſubmiſſion and ſimplicity.</p>
                  <p>Spiritual Authors tell us, there be three ſorts of paſſivity. The firſt, not approved by them, is, when a Soul, yet very imperfect in Prayer, expects extraordinary illuminations from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by neglecting to help her ſelf with conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations ſuitable to her condition. The ſecond, doubtful and call'd in queſtion, is, when a Soul yet imperfect, provides her ſelf of no ſubject for Meditation and mental Prayer, but expects that God ſhould furniſh her immediately with matter for it. The third, good and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is, when a purified Soul receives Divine impreſſions in her Spiritual Exerciſes.</p>
                  <p>'Tis alſo of high concern to obſerve well, that a Soul may be Divinely inſpir'd to this or that undertaking, or kind of Life in ſuch different ways, that to diſcern perfectly the Call of God, will be ſomewhat difficult.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>God ſometimes works upon a Soul by his Grace, joyntly with the Light of reaſon, to move her to thoſe things, which do not tranſcend, but are conformable to the dictates thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:57606:111"/> 2. <hi>There are ſome things, to do which we can have no motions but only by the Light of Grace and Inſtinct of the Holy Spirit. But thoſe whom we conſult about them, ought to be experienced in Spiritual matters, and in whom the Light of Grace is more predominant than that of reaſon. For if thoſe inſtincts are purely from God, the light of nature is no fit judge of Supernatural Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: From whence ariſe great troubles to perſons ſo inſpir'd, by meeting with contradictions on every ſide. A Director muſt be highly elevated in Grace, to diſcern between the motions of Grace and reaſon: And therefore 'tis no wonder to ſee ſome good men, of good judgment, not to reliſh or approve of ſome manner of extraordinary Devotion. Great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and fidelity is requiſite to follow ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts of Grace; for Senſe and Reaſon, and their Partizans, (who are no ſmall number,) will man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſtrong diſputes with them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will begin my Exerciſes, taking God for my only Conductor; but nevertheleſs am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, according to the method preſcrib'd to me by a Friend, on Gods behalf, to take up my thoughts principally with the Infinite and Eternal Perfections of the Divine Perſons of the moſt Sacred Trinity, and ſet apart at leaſt four hours a day for Prayer and Meditation.</p>

                     <head>Firſt Day.</head>
                     <p>BE taking my ſelf to Prayer the firſt day, I was ſeis'd with aſtoniſhment, that men ſo little conſider'd this ineffable Myſtery. Yea, great Devotes are much taken up with it, but apply themſelves either to the Saints, or the Myſteries of Jeſus Chriſt, which is very well done; however this grand Myſtery ought to be the principal Object of their Thoughts and Adorations.</p>
                     <p>O Myſtery of Myſteries, foundation of all other Myſteries! A Myſtery not only Divine, but God himſelf involv'd within himſelf. A My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Beauties and Eternal Grandeurs. A Myſtery of Eternal Raviſhments, in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Infinite Perfections of the God-head. O Grand Myſtery, too much forgotten by us, who think but little on theſe Infinite Productions. The greateſt of Myſteries, and the moſt forgotten.</p>
                     <p>O my Soul, let not this juſtly be charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, but be often attentive to theſe eternal emanations, adore them continually, and ſing on Earth the Song of the Angels in Heaven, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy in Eſſence, Holy in At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, Holy in all his Ways, and all his Works.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This preſent Retreat will work much good in me, by putting me in mind of my Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the adorable Trinity. Hereafter nothing ſhall appear to me ſo great and beautiful, as
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57606:112"/> this employ about the moſt Sacred Trinity. The application to Saints, and Myſteries of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus muſt yield to this, and not appear while this poſſeſſes my Soul, nor take place 'till God is pleas'd to change this diſpoſition.</p>
                     <p>In my ſecond Prayer I conſider'd, that my Soul was created to be an expreſs and excellent Image of the moſt Sacred Trinity: God having made it Spiritual, Intelligent, and Loving, to exerciſe in her his Divine operations, which are the knowledge and love of God. Entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this <hi>Idaea,</hi> I conſider'd, that the found of our Interiour ought to be a Pure Manſion for God himſelf and his Divine operations; and that the beſt Prayer we can make, and moſt acceptable to his Majeſty, is to annihilate all the Powers of our Soul in her operations, that God may work in us, who can only know and love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, according to his infinite Perfections. That our underſtanding be not otherwiſe imployed, then to adore God preſent in his operations, and the will to conſent thereto. That the Soul wholly apply her ſelf to Gods workings in us, correſponding in all things to his good will and pleaſure, by a ready and faithful co-operation.</p>
                     <p>O how did I diſcover clearly the abuſes moſt men commit by profaning the Faculties of their Soul, in employing them about Vanities and unprofitable Curioſities, as are for the moſt part our Worldly Affairs? We ſee not except in a Retreat and Solitude, how Worldly buſineſs hinders the actual knowledge and love of God, wherein conſiſts the true Life of our Soul. O the happy condition of true Solitaries! O how
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:57606:112"/> great Wiſdom is it, to free our ſelves from Worldly Affairs, the better to mind the one thing neceſſary, that is, to live a life Divine, for which we were created! Let us, O my Soul, flie from diſtractions, and the amuſement of Affairs, which engage us in a thouſand Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, Vanities, Extravagancies, and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. Let us be Faithful, O my Soul, and give our ſelves up wholly to God, that we may live up to the end of our Creation.</p>
                     <p>In my third Prayer this Truth made deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on me, that the moſt Sacred Trinity <hi>made Man after the Image of God,</hi> which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards being disfigured by ſin, the ſame ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Trinity vouchſafed to imprint it anew, and more exactly in our Holy Baptiſm, when we are Baptiz'd, <hi>In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> We owe our Chriſtianity to this impreſſion of the three Divine Perſons: We enter not into the Church, but by this great and ineffable Myſtery, which is the foundation of our <hi>Catholick Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I do not ſee that the Sacred Trinity brings forth any thing created of a more noble Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction than a Chriſtian; the whole Machine of the World is leſs conſiderable, for the order thereof is only Natural, but a Chriſtian is a Supernatural work, wherein it ſeems the moſt Sacred Trinity takes delight to be born as it were anew, by imprinting his Image in our Souls. Shall we deface this Image, to make our Souls deformed by ſome monſtruous reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance?</p>
                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:57606:113"/>
                     <p> Yet this is that we do, O my Soul, when inſtead of carefully preſerving the Image of the moſt Sacred Trinity imprinted on us by Baptiſm, not conſidering the great Honour and Happineſs we receive thereby, we deform our ſelves by ſin, and deface this Image with unclean reſemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. O my Soul, when ſhall we be purified? Flie from the World, and betake thy ſelf to a Holy Solitude.</p>
                     <p>For my fourth Prayer God was pleas'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire me with this thought, that my Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation ought to be in Heaven already, that is, in God; for 'tis God is our Heaven, and 'tis in Him I ought to take up my Manſion; ſeeing I was created to conſider his Eternal and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Affairs, and to contemplate his Infinite Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. I call the Eternal Affairs of God, his Divine Interiour operations; the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Eternal Word, the proceſſion of the Holy Spirit, and the Infinite Complacency which he takes in his incomprehenſible Beauties and Grandeurs; the Eternal Deſigns of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Word made Fleſh, which was to be accompliſh'd in the fulneſs of time; in which however he took an Infinite ſatisfaction from all Eternity.</p>
                     <p>I call the Temporal Affairs of God, the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his Divine Decrees, touching the Myſtery of the Incarnation and Paſſion of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, the Creation of the World, the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and Reprobation of Men, God before all time having Infinite Sallies in himſelf, by the Production of the Son and Holy Spirit, hath in time had Sallies out of himſelf full of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:57606:113"/> and admiration. O my God, how a Soul enlightned from Heaven finds great joy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in contemplating theſe Eternal and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Verities, out of which all is but deceit and vanity!</p>
                     <p>But how low Spirited are they, who never attempt the knowledge of theſe Truths? For my part, I will never more ſtand in admiration, to ſee the Holy Hermits forſake the World, with intentions never more to return to earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matters, when once they have diſcover'd the Truth and Beauty of things Eternal and Divine. O my God, make me dead to the World, that I may live to you alone, and my Thoughts may be only taken up with your Perfections.</p>

                     <head>Second Day.</head>
                     <p>BEhold, what ſuddenly comes into my mind about this great and incomprehenſible Myſtery: I am wonderfully content to be in a ſtate of inability to underſtand it, in that the Powers of my Soul are led captive by Faith, ſurrounded with Clouds. This inability, this obſcurity, this captivity are pleaſing to me; and for the future I'll believe that there is no better way upon earth to pleaſe God, then by ſubmitting our underſtanding and will to his Revelations: Yea, I do more value this cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity to Faith in believing what I ſee not, than all Splendours imaginable. How is this ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:57606:114"/> of our Spirit, naturally curious and inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, pleaſing to God! How much hereby do we honour and glorifie him?</p>
                     <p>O glorious Saints, with all due reverence I challenge you to be more in love with your Eternal Splendours, than I am with theſe Clouds of Holy Faith. If you be content, I am no leſs, to be ſo happy as willingly to captivate my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to the high Myſteries God has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. And that which fills me with joy, and makes me happy before I come to Heaven, is to find my will in perfect ſubmiſſion to my God, and to the meaneſt Creature for love of him. O bleſſed Souls, I am a little too bold with you, yet I ſpeak the Truth, and ye well know it. I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to Perfection of Divine Love, and this ſubmiſſion is the way to practiſe it. A way ſure and excellent.</p>
                     <p>In my ſecond Prayer, I yet found my Soul taken up with the Grandeurs of this incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible Myſtery; and being almoſt loſt in this Ocean of infinite wonders, was full of Faith and Sweetneſs, at the ſight of ſuch adorable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, though all ſurrounded with clouds of darkneſs. For as ſoon as this Myſtery preſents it ſelf to the eye of the Soul, her light is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured, and caſts our Spirit into a thick dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which yet brings with it a Light to ſee what reaſon cannot. <hi>Nox illuminatio mea, My night hath ſome day,</hi> and I perceive the Infinite diſtance between the Creator and his Creature; and being plung'd into the Abiſs of my own Nothingneſs, I acknowledge, O my God, and adore your Grandeurs and Perfections. I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, I love, I obey.</p>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:57606:114"/>
                     <p> O my God, I adore and believe ſtedfaſtly what you are pleas'd to reveal to your Church. I neither know, nor comprehend, nor deſire it, but am content with my ignorance and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Let us, O my Soul, abide as low and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as Grace can make us; for nothing renders us more pleaſing to God, than profound Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and annihilation. God who is infinitely delighted to dwell in his own Grandeurs, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo well pleas'd to ſee an abject Creature content with its own nothing. 'Tis an error in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality, and ſavours of ſelf-love, to ſhun ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection under pretence to advance our ſelves in Divine Love. O my Soul, let us comply with Gods will, and march on in the ways of abjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if God be pleas'd to require it of us.</p>
                     <p>My third Prayer paſs'd on in theſe Thoughts; that the moſt Sacred Trinity being Eternally <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> Subſtantial, my Soul ought to endeavour to produce in her ſelf an actual knowledge and love of God, the better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble this adorable Trinity. A Soul in the ſtate of Contemplation, renders this honour to God in a more peculiar manner, enjoying God by the guift of Prayer in as tranſcendent a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as Mortality permits.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, the proſpect I have of this Divine Life here below, draws my Soul Powerfully after it, and I love it better than formerly: But I ſee that to perſevere therein, we muſt be very poor in Spirit, that is, not only free from exorbitant Paſſions, but all diſtracting Images which paſs by the ſenſes that are not Mortified. News attended with curioſity, or the eyes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:57606:115"/> to ſenſible objects, or ſuch like immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, fill the Soul with unprofitable Images, which make her uncapable of Divine impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, by correſponding to which we moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit our ſelves, and moſt glorifie God.</p>
                     <p>In my fourth Prayer I was taken up with a view of thoſe amorous complacencies, and thoſe Infinite joyes, wherewith the three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perſons repleniſh the Souls of the bleſſed in Heaven. It ſeem'd to me, that the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Saints was the clear viſion of the Ineffable Myſtery of the moſt Sacred Trinity; and to be made partakers of that knowledge and love, which is reciprocal among the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perſons. To ſee God clearly, is the Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical Viſion.</p>
                     <p>Alas! how ought we to be humbled, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how Infinitely we fall ſhort in our Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the continual <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> of the Saints in Glory! Yet this is the end of our Creation, and our hope is at laſt to bear them company. O how this life is poor and miſerable, where all is vanity and vexation of Spirit?</p>
                     <p>The view of my own weakneſs making me ſenſible that all I do for God is as nothing, what ſhall I ſay at the ſight of my ſins and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? I have nothing to ſay, dear Lord, but that I merit Eternal Confuſion; which muſt needs fall upon me, unleſs your goodneſs have pity on me, according to the greatneſs of your Mercies. Can we imagine we can do any thing too much for God? 'Tis for the glory of his Bounty and Goodneſs, that he is pleas'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of our ſmall ſervice and endeavours, and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:57606:115"/> reward them eternally. O how great a Truth is it, that Grace and Glory are the effects of his pure Goodneſs and Mercy vouchſafed to us! Bleſſed be his Name to all Eternity.</p>

                  <div n="3" type="day">
                     <head>Third Day.</head>
                     <p>IN my firſt Prayer of this day, I conſider'd that the three Divine Perſons were Happy in Contemplation of themſelves from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. When they created the World, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and Government thereof does not at diſturb their repoſe and Felicity. The Father is the center of the Son, and the Father and the Son is the center of the Holy Ghoſt, Three in One, and one in Three, Infinitely Happy in each other before all Time, and ſhall be to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. O what raviſhing Beauties do they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in each other, and what unſpeakable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights do they take in ther Infinite Perfections? Nothing without them can interrupt their Joys, or add to their Happineſs.</p>
                     <p>Tho true Solitaries who live the Life of God, in like manner repoſe only in him, and being dead to themſelves and all Creatures, live only in him, to him, and for him. O Divine Life of Solitude! Thou art here begun on Earth, and canſt not be perfected but in Heaven. A true Hermits life is not a Senſual, but Divine Life.</p>
                     <p>God calling me to Contemplation, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to Church, as to a Hermitage, where I
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:57606:116"/> may live this Divine Life. The <hi>Pſalmody</hi> there much rejoyces my heart, and lifts up my Soul to Contemplation. Through Natural Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations I have condeſcended to pleaſe others, againſt my own inclination; but now I have the Happineſs to converſe with the three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perſons, I can no more reliſh the Company of my Friends and Relations, except rarely, to maintain Peace and Union, or for ſome great neceſſity; and if they be diſpleas'd, I muſt not value it.</p>
                     <p>My ſecond Prayer was an amorous attention upon what paſt Eternally among the three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perſons: How the Father knowing his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perfections did beget his Son, and how the Father and the Son by an Infinite Love did produce the Holy Ghoſt. The Father is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Ocean of Perfections, by an Infinite Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundity begetting his Son, and they being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorpt in each other, produce the Holy Spirit, by an everlaſting flux and reflux of Love. This I did contemplate with great repoſe of Soul, and yielded up the Intellectual Powers thereof to the obedience of Faith, to receive ſome Rayes of Divine Light about ſuch great and Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible Myſteries.</p>
                     <p>God then working in my Soul, I became paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, contenting my ſelf to behold ſimply and ſweetly the Infinite operations of the Sacred Trinity, and ſaid within my ſelf, Bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity know your ſelves, for I can do nothing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it; 'tis enough for me to contemplate that mutual Love which is among you, which I believe and admire with adoration. It ſeems
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:57606:116"/> to me that no other Myſtery of our Faith can ſo take up and content my Soul, nothing being more Divine than the Divinity. No other practice is ſo charming to me, we being crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to know that Knowledge, and to love that Love, which God has to himſelf to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                     <p>In my third Prayer I conſider'd, the Souls of Juſt Men and Bleſſed Spirits are as ſo many Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Veſſels, into whom God infuſes his love and knowledge by a continual emanation. Which love and knowledge returns to God, its ſource; as the water of a running Fountain riſes as high as the Spring, from whence it had its Origen. This love and knowledge does eſtabliſh God in us, and alſo does firmly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh us in God. So that God takes a delight and repoſe in the Soul, and the Soul finds her center and reſt in him: Thereby faintly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting how the Divine Perſons have a mutual repoſe in each other.</p>
                     <p>Empty Veſſels are moſt capable to be fill'd: And by how much the more our Souls are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty of Self-love and Nature, by ſo much the more are they capable of Divine Love and Knowledge. A Soul in ſuch a ſtate delights in Solitude, and cares not to live in the thoughts and affections of men. What moſt ſaddens our Spirits, and retards us in the ways of God, is a natural averſion we have from a hidden life. For man naturally deſires to be known and lov'd, and thinks life is as nothing without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. And as long as we are full of this liquor, we are not veſſels proper to receive the influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57606:117"/> of Divine Love and Knowledge. Let us, O my Soul, empty our ſelves of Self-love, that Divine Love may take place in us.</p>
                     <p>In my fourth Prayer, I found an amorous complacency in my Soul, in that God being but One, doth ſubſiſt in three Perſons, knowing and loving themſelves, wherein conſiſts their Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. The Father is the ſource of Being, the the Son the term of his Knowledge, and the Holy Spirit of his Love. The Son and Holy Ghoſt are from the Father: The Father and the Holy Spirit know the Son: The Father and the Son love the Holy Ghoſt. Theſe are the wonders that make Heaven Happy. Firmly to believe them, is our Bleſſedneſs on Earth, and to Contemplate them continually brings ſolid conſolation to the Soul.</p>
                     <p>I ſaw clearly that to diſpoſe my ſelf for this incomparable Happineſs, I was to purifie my Interiour, and to mortifie ſome natural reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which yet live in me: As namely, too great a fear about the loſs of Worldly things, or to be deſpis'd by others, or ill ſucceſs of Affairs; beſides too great a ſenſe of humane re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, and a backwardneſs to follow the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts of Grace for worldly conſiderations.</p>
                     <p>I know God ſometimes ſuffers theſe Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to live in us, for the exerciſe of Virtue, and the Tryal of our Fidelity: However his will is, that we ſtrive to be dead to the World and our ſelves, having our affections ſo fix'd on Heavenly things, as to live a Divine Life in Mortal Bodies. Believe me, 'till our Interiour be throughly purified, we ſhall not not be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:57606:117"/> of high contemplation, nor arrive to much knowledge in the ſecrets of God.</p>

                     <head>Fourth Day.</head>
                     <p>IN my firſt Prayer I was principally taken up with the adorable Perſon of the Eternal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Methought I ſaw how he was raviſh'd with Infinite Joy in Himſelf, with the Son and the Holy Spirit: And what complacency he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo took in the Suffering of the Humanity of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, though he loves him with the ſame love wherewith he loves himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And becauſe theſe ſufferings were pleaſing to his Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as ſatisfactory for our ſins, he did thirſt to ſuffer more, to fulfill his will. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after ſuch variety of dolorous ſufferings, dying on the <hi>Croſs,</hi> he cryed out, <hi>Sitio, I Thirſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It much rejoyc'd my heart to ſee what Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Complacency the three Divine Perſons took in the Divinity, and ſaid within my ſelf, <hi>O Sacred Trinity, enjoy eternally theſe Infinite delights;</hi> But I deſire as much as I can to add to your Exteriour Contentments, by imitating the ſuffering of my Bleſſed Saviour. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I will not have ſo much an eye to the reward, to pleaſe the Sacred Trinity, whom I adore.</p>
                     <p>Behold then what hereupon, it ſeems to me, God put into my mind. 1. <hi>To eat neither Fiſh nor Fleſh, but in caſe of Sickneſs.</hi> 2. <hi>To Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline every day:</hi> 3. <hi>To be pleas'd with occaſions</hi>
                        <pb n="208" facs="tcp:57606:118"/> 
                        <hi>of Contempt.</hi> 4. <hi>To deſpiſe all Temporal things, to follow the attracts of Divine Love.</hi> 5. <hi>To lie down upon a hard Bed.</hi> 6. <hi>To cut off all Worldly Viſits, and retire my ſelf into a Solitude, where the World may deſpiſe me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I conſider'd in my ſecond Prayer, that the Son of God in the boſom of his Divine Father, in poſſeſſion of Infinite Delights and Joys un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable, out of love to his Father, did quit his boſom, and cloath himſelf with Mortal Fleſh, to plunge himſelf in the depth of Miſeries, abjection and ſufferings, that he might glorifie his Divine Father by his humane and ſuffering Life; and teach us Men, his Brethren, that the way to enter into the Love and Glory of his Father, is by the gate of Sufferings.</p>
                     <p>Is it You, O only begotten Son of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Father, is it You born in a Stable, working in a Shop, dying on a <hi>Croſs?</hi> You that are all Splendor and Glory, the Light of the World, and the Delight of Heaven? Is it You that are ſo poor and abject, ſo void of Friends, ſo full of Diſgraces, ſo ſcorn'd and deſpis'd? Is it You whom they eſteem as the out-caſt of men, and not worthy to live on the face of the Earth? O the Love of the Son towards his Father! O the ſtrange invention of the Son to advance the Glory of his Father! O my Jeſus, how admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable are you in your Divinity! But how ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able are you in your Humanity! I deſire, O dear Jeſus, to follow you all the days of my life, and ſeek no other Glory than in your <hi>Croſs</hi> and Poverty, your Humiliations and Sufferings. <hi>Abſit mihi gloriari niſi in Cruce Domini noſtri</hi>
                        <pb n="109" facs="tcp:57606:118"/> 
                        <hi>Jeſu Chriſti. The Croſs of Chriſt is my Crown and Glory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We ought not to poſſeſs Honours, Riches, and Worldly Preferments without Fear and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. Have we not cauſe to fear that in a ſtate of Worldly greatneſs Nature will ſeek her ſelf, and not follow Jeſus, poor and humble, which ought to be done, either effectively, or in affection? A ſtate of Suffering under the <hi>Croſs</hi> is truly Glorious, and full of Interiour Conſolation.</p>
                     <p>In my third Prayer I conſider'd, that the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Father with the Son, and of the Son with the Father, is by the Holy Ghoſt; a union Infinite and adorable. O Holy Spirit, ſeeing 'tis your property to unite, unite my heart ſo intimately to the adorable Trinity preſent in me, that I may never ſuffer a ſeperation; and that this adorable union may be frequent in my Thoughts and Meditations.</p>
                     <p>Bleſſed be your Holy Name, my God, that you are pleas'd to be ſo merciful unto me, as to take up my thoughts with this incomprehenſible Myſtery. O how do I begin too late, having been too long amuz'd with vain trifles! My paſt Life diſpleaſes me, and the courſe of the World is troubleſome unto me, ſeeing it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders me from converſing with you as I deſire. Natural Neceſſities, as to Eat, to Sleep, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creat, are burdenſom unto a Soul quickened with your Spirit, ſtrongly inclining us to live here on Earth as in Heaven, in a perfect and perpetual union with your Goodneſs.</p>
                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:57606:119"/>
                     <p> The conſideration which took up my thoughts in my fourth Prayer, was, that the Eternal Son and Holy Spirit ſeem'd to have more commerce with men then the Eternal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; becauſe they appeared to us by external Miſſions, the Son being made Man for to die for us; and the Holy Spirit taking divers forms for the Service of man, and to enflame our hearts with Divine Love. The Eternal Father ſeem'd always to remain in himſelf raviſh'd with his own Infinite Beauties and Perfections. O adorable Manſion of the Eternal Father within himſelf! O wonderful Miſſions of the Son and Holy Spirit towards us Men, and for our Salvation, eternal matter of Adoration!</p>
                     <p>O my God, when ſhall I go out of my ſelf, to elevate my heart to you, and converſe with you? I ſee very well that to enter into a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Prayer, Retirement is requiſite, Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and Spiritual Exerciſes: And to conſerve the ſame temper of Soul, we muſt practice ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence as much as our condition and affairs will permit. If the Son of God and Holy Spirit did appear here upon Earth only for our good, certainly we ought to endeavour, to have our Converſation in Heaven, and adore the moſt Sacred Trinity for theſe Infinite Mercies.</p>

                     <head>Fifth Day.</head>
                     <p>MY firſt Prayer paſt in acknowledgment and admiration of the Fulneſs of God. An Infinite Fulneſs containing an Infinity of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, each of which hath an Infinity of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies incomprehenſible, A Fulneſs which is the Source of all good in the Creature, we being of our ſelves but a meer privation and pure nothing, full of imperfections, and lyable to Infinite Miſeries. Alas! O my God, I now ſee more then ever that you are all good, <hi>Omne bonum,</hi> you are the Source of our Being and Exiſtence, and without your continual influx for our preſervation, we ſhould in a moment return to our firſt nothing.</p>
                     <p>The general <hi>Idaea</hi> of this Truth is in every underſtanding, but well to conſider it, and lodge it in our Heart, is very rare. We believe this, as many other points of our Religion, but without deep reflection or correſpondent acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Hence it proceeds that we are without perfect ſelf-denyal and abnegation, being not ſufficiently perſwaded, that of our ſelves we are nothing. And therefore God leaves in us many Imperfections unconquer'd, that we may know by experience, that we are of our ſelves nothing but weakneſs.</p>
                     <p>O my God, for ever Bleſſed be your Holy Name, for diſcovering to me your Fulneſs, and my Poverty. I adore your Infinite Fulneſs
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:57606:120"/> with a cordial affection, becauſe it ſhews your Grandeurs: and I am pleas'd with my Poverty becauſe it humbles me in your preſence. I am well content, O my God, to be nothing, that you may be all.</p>
                     <p>Kneeling down to make my ſecond Prayer, I deſir'd our Bleſſed Saviour to take up my thoughts with what he pleas'd. And it came into my mind, to conſider the three Divine Perſons, as they are to teach other the center of all Happineſs, repoſe and Glory. I beheld this fixedly, and with an amorous reſentment and complacency of mind, it ſeeming to me, that the repoſe, the joy, and the Glory that the Divine Perſons have in the Sacred Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is infinitely below that repoſe and Glory they have in themſelves: And that delight they have in the Saints, is much below that which they have in the Sacred Humanity. I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times adored this Divine center in it ſelf; and ſometimes I adored the occupations of the Soul of Jeſus towards this Divine center; and I endeavour'd to fix my thoughts with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency therein.</p>
                     <p>God then gave me to ſee, that accidental oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of Charity are not repugnant to my So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude and deſigns of extraordinary Devotion: But to take upon me the care of a Family, and to have a continual eye over them, as I had formerly, was inconſiſtant with it. For that engag'd me to many Conferences, many Letters, much care and Extroverſion; and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent God does not require that of me, but calls me to a retreat, to Solitude, to Exteriour and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57606:120"/> Silence, to Mortification, to converſe with Him alone. This is my preſent affair up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth.</p>
                     <p>In my third Prayer I diſcover'd how juſt and reaſonable it is, not only to adore the Divine Life of the moſt Sacred Trinity, but alſo to Honour the Service which the Soul of Jeſus render'd to his Father on Earth by a continual and ineffable application. I obſerv'd that all the Myſteries of the Life of Jeſus are honour'd according to the various applications of devout Souls as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd from Heaven. Some have a ſpecial De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to Jeſus, as regarding <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> with an eye of Mercy: Others are much taken with his Divine Diſcourſes with the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman and her Converſion: And ſhall we forget to adore the Divine regards and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe the Soul of Jeſus continually had with the Divine Perſons? There's nothing in God made man more worthy of veneration, this being his moſt noble employment while he was upon Earth.</p>
                     <p>Let us therefore, O my Soul, according to our Duty ſet upon this work without delay. Let our greateſt care be to pleaſe Jeſus; and then many Worldly affairs will become burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom unto us. Let us recollect our Spirits and Affections from other things, and place them wholly on God our final Happineſs. A true Chriſtian indeed will be ſo generous, as to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem all things beſides God, not worth his labour. 'Tis true, while the Soul is impriſon'd in the Walls of fleſh, ſhe cannot always ſoar up to Heaven on the wings of Contemplation;
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:57606:121"/> but this ſhe muſt ſigh after, and conſidering her preſent condition, on all occaſions exerciſe her ſelf in works of Humility.</p>
                     <p>In my fourth Prayer God and his Perfections did poſſeſs my Soul, rejoycing in that he was perfect and happy. I had a mind then to take up my thoughts wholly with the Perfections of God, without any reflection on my own Interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, or requeſting any thing to ſupply my wants, for 'tis not ſeaſonable to do this, when God calls us to contemplate his adorable Perfections. The Soul then forgets his own Intereſts, to mind only thoſe of God.</p>
                     <p>I then was preſſed with a vehement deſire, to forget my ſelf entirely, and have God only in my remembrance. I was then much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the multitude that followed Jeſus in the Deſart, taking no care for Bodyly Proviſion. Their Divine Maſter provided for them, being well pleas'd with their affection, in being only attentive to his words. What content was it to me to remember how <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> forgot her ſelf, yea, in ſome ſort our Bleſſed Saviour, in not ſerving him in her Caſtle at <hi>Bethanie,</hi> by reaſon ſhe was ſo intent on his Divine words? O my Soul, let us not be too Solicitous for the things of this Life; if we think on God, he will think on us, and nothing neceſſary ſhall be wanting to us.</p>

                     <head>Sixth Day.</head>
                     <p>IN my firſt Prayer my Soul found her ſelf much taken with the Beauty of thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent words in the Goſpel, <hi>Be ye perfect, as your Heavenly Father is perfect.</hi> I conſider'd how impoſſible it is for Mortals even to conceive the <hi>Idaea</hi> of an Infinite Perfection, and if we cannot conceive it, how can we imitate it? But God the Father has provided againſt this inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, in ſending to us the perfect Image of all his Infinite Perfections, his Eternal Son; and expoſing him to our view, ſays to us, <hi>Be perfect, as your Heavenly Father is perfect; open your eyes and behold this Model, here is the Perfection you muſt imitate, let it be your care to conform to this Exemplar, and you will be perfect as I am perfect</hi> 'Tis hard to ſay to what ſublimity of Perfection we are call'd by a Chriſtian Life; and how glorious a thing it is, even to pretend to imitate God himſelf?</p>
                     <p>But alas! how far are we from the Spirit of this grand Exemplar? Jeſus would have us to be annihilated, poor, deſpis'd, living a hidden life in Solitude, by dayly converſe with God: But juſt contrary, we deſire to appear in the World, to be eſteemed, to have all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our hearts deſire, and enjoy the Creatures. Alas! we do not ſufficiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to dive into the inclinations of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Jeſus, to conform our ſelves thereto,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:57606:122"/> and annihilate our own. The Science of Jeſus is not well known, there are few perſons that ſtudy it ſufficiently; and fewer that practice it in Purity, and really aſpire to form the true image of Jeſus in them.</p>
                     <p>In my ſecond Prayer I did apply my ſelf to conſider, how the Son of God being eternally in the midſt between the Father and the Holy Spirit, came down from Heaven to be a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator between his Eternal Father and us Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. He tells us, that no man can come to Father but by him, and that he is the way which leads to Happineſs. And is it not a ſad caſe that men ſhould ſo much go aſtray? This is a low, and humble way, and they puff'd up with Pride will march over mountains in ways above them. This is a poor, penitential, ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring way, and they are for a way eaſie, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, rich and commodious. Is it poſſible to come to the boſom of the Eternal Father, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we will march by the way of his Son? There's no other way to come to him, and if we take our own way, at every ſtep we go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from him.</p>
                     <p>O my God, how long ſhall my Soul lag be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, meerly in a way of nature? When ſhall we, O my Soul, enter into Diſpoſitions truly Chriſtian, and conform to the Dictates of a ſupernatural Life? O Jeſus, my Saviour, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, my Exemplar, my Way, my Light, 'tis only by following you, and your Divine Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims, that we can enter into the light of Life. Of neceſſity then we muſt paſs by Jeſus Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to come to the Divinity of the Father, and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:57606:122"/> enjoy Jeſus Glorified. We muſt take up our <hi>Croſs</hi> and follow him, if we will enter into Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</p>
                     <p>My third Prayer was a continuation of like Thoughts. I then underſtood that there's no entring into Society with the three Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; or arriving to ſuch a height of Prayer, as thereby we may live in them a Divine Life, but by entring into communication with Jeſus Chriſt, and conforming our Life to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
                     <p>This is a general Rule without exception. The Life of Jeſus was a ſevere, ſelf-denying Life. and ours ought to be of ſuch an auſterity, as may not ruine our health, or dull the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but humble the Body, to elevate the Soul. In a word, we muſt daily endeavour to humble and annihilate our ſelves, having only in our eye the Will of God. The Eternal Father can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take delight in any Soul, that does not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to reſemble his Son.</p>
                     <p>It concerns us therefore to examine our hearts, to ſee how they ſtand affected to Sufferings on all occaſions, If we cannot reliſh them, but flie and complain, 'tis to be fear'd, nature does poſſeſs us, and not the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt. Water in a glaſs remains quiet, but if it finds the leaſt paſſage, it tends to its own element, from whence it can only be kept by force: In like manner a Soul that has overtures of Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings afforded her, will find an inclination to embrace them, if Jeſus Crucified be her center. It matters not by what means theſe occaſions to ſuffer happen, whether by the imprudence of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:57606:123"/> Friends, or the malice of Enemies. Or her own neglect, or any other accident, ſhe layes hold on the occaſion, to unite her ſelf to the abjections of Jeſus, as to her center, Happy is that Soul which is in this temper, Grace and the Spirit of Jeſus has wrought it in her.</p>
                     <p>In my fourth Prayer I went on to entertain my ſelf with the wonders of the Son of God. I admir'd that being in the Glory of his Father, he deſcended to our Miſeries, that he might glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie his Father in a new manner; by purchaſing for him ſuch holy Souls, who being animated with his Spirit, after his example, would be in love with Sufferings for Gods ſake I ſaw clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly how the Son of God by his Eternal Birth is moſt glorious with Infinite Perfections; and how he became Man, to be capable of Sufferings for our ſake: And that we muſt follow Jeſus in his Humiliations, if we will be partakers of his Glory. O what dark Souls have they, who ſee not theſe Glorious Truths? We live here a ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alor worldly life, or at moſt do follow the light of reaſon, rarely do we live a Chriſtian, and very rarely a Divine Life. A thouſand times happy are they, who dear Jeſus, are enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by you the true Light of the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </p>
                     <p>Jeſus Chriſt cloath'd himſelf with a Mortal Body, that he might ſuffer, and be Sacrific'd upon the <hi>Croſs;</hi> and we ought to bear part with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Saints who have known and taſted of his Spirit, have Martyr'd their Bodies by a thouſand Auſterities. Others have waſted away by degrees in the flames of Divine Love. All have been deſirous to ſuffer more or leſs.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:57606:123"/> But we are afraid to hurt our ſelves, and are too apprehenſive to endamage our Health. For whom do we keep our embraces, or for what is it, that we are ſo deſirous to live long upon Earth? 'Tis a vain fear to think we ſhall ſhorten our days, by our endeavouring to live a Divine Life in our Mortal Bodies.</p>

                     <head>Seventh Day.</head>
                     <p>I Began my firſt Prayer by a peculiar inſtinct of the Holy Spirit, bringing often to my mind thoſe precious words of St. <hi>Paul, God hath ſent the Spirit of his Son into our Hearts, crying</hi> Abba <hi>Father.</hi> And then I found that a Soul aſſiſted with the extraordinary infuſions of the Holy Spirit, is elevated above her ſelf; which is the effect of the gift of Wiſdom freely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, whereby ſhe ſees and taſts the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable Myſteries of our Religion. O what a gracious gift is this! What a great favour is it, when God is pleas'd thus to communicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto us! It then ſeem'd to me, that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of my Soul ceas'd their ordinary opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the obſcurity of Faith as it were va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd; this Divine Wiſdom elevating them in ſuch a manner, which they cannot conceive who know not by experience, to a very ſublime way of working, much above their ordinary proceedings. The Soul ſtands wondring at it, and can hardly believe ſhe could arrive to ſuch a point of Perfection.</p>
                     <pb n="220" facs="tcp:57606:124"/>
                     <p> Then a Divine Light gave me to ſee at once my unworthineſs to receive the Graces of God, his Goodneſs and Mercy to beſtow them on me, and the merits of Chriſt whereby they were purchas'd. I was much amaz'd that God ſhould vouchſafe ſo great favours to ſo wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſinner. And I did melt in acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, being humbled in my ſelf, with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire confidence in the merits of Jeſus.</p>
                     <p>I continued my ſecond Prayer, and this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light increas'd in my Soul, and diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the favours God vouchſafes to Souls; of which there are many degrees, according to the proportion of their Purity of heart.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>They ſee the Deformity of Sin clear enough, to conceive a horrour and deteſtation of it; and know confuſedly the Chriſtian Virtues, the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Sacred Humanity, and Divinity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>They ſee more clearly ſome Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; as an Eternity of a Happy or Miſerable condition after this Life; that our Salvation is our Principal concern, and the one thing neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; aend that all things elſe are but deceit and vanity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>They conſidering the Myſteries of Jeſus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to diſcover the beauty of his Humiliations and Sufferings, which yet is ſhadowed with ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Their eyes being more open'd, they behold diſtinctly the Beauty of the Sufferings, Contempts,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Then, if they keep cloſe to Purity of Heart, they are wholly in a manner taken up with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Humane Myſteries of Jeſus; being very ſenſible what an Infinite Mercy it is, to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd from the darkneſs of that ignorance, which is in carnal men, who have no feeling in the things of God or their Salvation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Their Light increaſing, they more and more diſcover the Perfections of God in the Creatures, more clearly without compariſon in the Sacred</hi> Humanity <hi>of Jeſus, but yet more tranſcendently in their Source, the Divinity; ſweetly applying themſelves thereto, with much Felicity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Behold, this is what God gave me to know <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n a little time; and this Light will increaſe, if I be Faithful to practice the Virtues of Jeſus Crucified; who is the <hi>True Way</hi> to the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the center of the Soul, and her perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                     <p>In my third Prayer I found my ſelf in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to admire the operations of the Holy Spirit in our Souls. God our Creator works in them what he pleaſes; he having endowed them with a certain capacity extraordinary to
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:57606:125"/> receive his extraordinary Divine operations. This muſt needs be extraordinary to our Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which before had great difficulty in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Myſteries of Faith, and with great obſcurity, and with little or no guſt: But no ſooner is this Light darted into our Souls, but we ſee and taſt them with great delight; not as in Glory, but in a very ſublime and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner. The Meditations of many years cannot attain to this; 'tis a ſpecial gift we muſt receive from the Father of Lights, to which we can only diſpoſe our ſelves by Humility and Mortification.</p>
                     <p>O what Happineſs is it for a Mortal man to be thus elevated and Spiritualiz'd by the Holy Ghoſt? Let us therefore O my Soul, humble our ſelves profoundly, for the Spirit of God takes not up his Manſion, but in a humble heart. I know we ought to go whither God is pleas'd to Call us, and not refuſe his Gifts under the pretence of a counterfeit Humility. But I know alſo that 'tis not diſpleaſing to God, for us to be careful how we entertain extraordinary at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, leaſt we be too ready, by innate Pride of heart, to walk in ways above our capacity.</p>
                     <p>In my fourth Prayer I conſider'd the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable preventions of the Holy Spirit in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Souls: How he awakes us from the ſleep of ſin, and draws us from the love of the World, to unite us to himſelf by undeſerved preventing Graces. What wonders are there, unknown to Carnal men, which paſs in theſe preventions? I know nothing that may work in us more Love, or more Humility. For would
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:57606:125"/> any but a God of Infinite Goodneſs look with an eye of Mercy upon a Soul all black with Sin, Ingratitude, and Infidelity? This miſerable Creature is beloved of God, having nothing to invite him, but on the contrary, to avert him from us: and if his exceeding love had not ſurmounted the Infinite hatred God has of ſin, we had periſh'd for ever without a Saviour. To Love us, Redeem us, and prevent us with ſuch Mercies, does only proceed from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible Goodneſs.</p>
                     <p>I am aſtoniſh'd to ſee that any Soul believing theſe admirable preventions, ſhould not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd with Divine Love. What can more humble a poor Creature, than to conſider that we are nothing but Miſery, from which we can never free our ſelves, unleſs God prevent us with his Grace and Favour? What can more enflame us with Divine Love, than to conſider that God then loved us, and prevented us with his unſpeakable Mercies, when we were juſt objects of his Eternal Hatred? O my God, who can comprehend the riches of your Infinite Goodneſs? O my Soul, acknowledge with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs the great obligations thou haſt to Love God with all thy Powers; and Loving him to Praiſe him to all Eternity.</p>

                     <head>Eighth Day.</head>
                     <p>IN my firſt Prayer this thought preſently poſſeſs'd my mind; that all Power is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Father, all Wiſdom to the Son, and all Goodneſs to the Holy Ghoſt: And ſeeing theſe three Divine Perſons are in each other, by a Communication of the ſame Subſtance and Infinite Perfections, the Eternal Father is the Power of the Son and Holy Ghoſt, the Son is the Wiſdom of the Father and Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the Holy Spirit is the Goodneſs of the Father and the Son. A pure Soul that lives in the ſublime exerciſes of a Supernatural Life, becomes a Manſion for the Divine Perſons, and receives from them the impreſſions of Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs.</p>
                     <p>The Power of the Eternal Father dwelling in her, gives her ſtrength and a Chriſtian genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, to conquer all the obſtacles of Perfection; and ſhe diſcovers that many difficulties are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imaginary than real; inſomuch as the Principal and the moſt difficult of Chriſtian actions, is to believe that they are poſſible, and that nature ſhall not ſuffer ſo much thereby as is imagin'd.</p>
                     <p>The Wiſdom of the Son cummunicated to her, affords her Light and Overtures to defend her ſelf againſt the apparent reaſons of ſenſual nature, which damp many excellent Spirits, that they can make no great advancement in the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:57606:126"/> ways of God, becauſe they have too much of humane conſideration, and too little of this Divine wiſdom, which diſcovers to us the Beauty of Contempts and Sufferings in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jeſus.</p>
                     <p>The Goodneſs of the Holy Spirit imprinted on her, makes her conquer the Inclinations of corrupted nature; which is more or leſs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the degrees of Grace in us. He that is Holy, let him be Holy ſtill; but we ſhall never riſe to the heighth, 'till we come to Glory.</p>
                     <p>In my ſecond Prayer I conſidered that the adorable Trinity is the Treaſury of all Beings, Increated and Created: That in reſpect to the Divine and Uncreated Beeing, the Eternal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a Treaſury that is exhauſted by commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating all his Infinite Perfections to the Son and Holy Ghoſt: But in reſpect of Created Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings the Sacred Trinity is an inexhauſtible Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, becauſe all the whole World, or ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand more cannot exhauſt or diminiſh the leaſt drop of his Infinite Power and Goodneſs.</p>
                     <p>I was almoſt equally taken up with both theſe wonders. That a Million of Worlds, drawn out of the Treaſury of Gods Omnipotency, ſhould not make the leaſt diminution of his Power, is certainly matter of admiration. But much more that the Grandeurs of the Eternal Son ſhould be ſo elevated above the World, as to exhauſt the whole Subſtance and Perfections of the Father, as that he cannot beget another like him.</p>
                     <p>O my Jeſus, how this Verity diſcover'd to me the Riches, the Glory, the Grandeurs of your
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:57606:127"/> Perſon! What Prodigious blindneſs has ſeis'd on men, as not to ſee this, and not to eſteem you above ten thouſand Worlds? You appear poor, humble, and abject in their eyes, and nevertheleſs 'tis true, the whole World is leſs than an Atomn in your preſence.</p>
                     <p>I took for the ſubject of my third Prayer this admirable Truth: That the Eternal Father is the ſource of the whole Divinity, which he Communicates to his Son, begotten of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, yet without any Superiority or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over him by his Paternity: And the Son who receives all from his Father, owes him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of thanks, of ſervice, or obedience. Not but that he knows his Father well deſerves all theſe returns: But being of the ſame Subſtance and Authority with him, he is not capable to render theſe Submiſſions.</p>
                     <p>But the Infinite love he has for his Father, made him go out of himſelf, and put himſelf into an Inferiour ſtate by his Incarnation, that he might render thoſe thanks, praiſes and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices which he merited, deſcending to thoſe wonderful Humiliations, and profound annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, whereby he might do homage to the Infinite Grandeurs of his Father. Teaching us by his example, that as the Son of God had no other means to honour his Father than by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations and Sufferings; ſo we ſhould take up our <hi>Croſs</hi> and follow him, that God may be Glorified.</p>
                     <p>My laſt Prayer this day was a profound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of this verity: That all the works of the adorable Trinity in relation to the Creatures
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:57606:127"/> are common to the three Divine Perſons. The Father, Son and Holy Spirit did concur in the ſame deſign of Creation, and Conſervation of the World, though the Father alone begets the Son, and the Holy Spirit proceeds from both: But all three united imploy'd their Power to do us good; as if We had been the object of their Beatitude.</p>
                     <p>Is it then true, O my God, that all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of your Providence by your united forces tend to our good, and ſhall we not have an eye to you? Alas! we little think on you, although the moſt ſerious Affairs of the World are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in compariſon of our concern to conſider your Infinite Perfections, and love your incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible Goodneſs. St. <hi>Arſenius</hi> ſaw this very well, when he quitted the Emperour, and would not ſo much as write to him. Thoſe who are thus nobly imploy'd, cannot be taken up with Worldly Vanities. You ſee a poor <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi> in the Deſarts of <hi>Thebais,</hi> ill Clad, abject and unknown, who ſeems to the eyes of Fleſh the ſcorn of men; however his Soul is wholly taken up with God, which is of more worth than the whole Univerſe: You ſee a great Prince glittering with Gold and precious Stones, with a great Train of Courtiers, Honoured and Reſpected of all; and in the <hi>Interim</hi> his Life being only taken up with Worldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, is guilty of the greateſt Folly, and of no eſteem in the eyes of God.</p>

                     <head>Ninth Day.</head>
                     <p>IN my Morning Prayer our Bleſſed Saviour plung'd me into the Abiſs of our own No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and Vileneſs; inſomuch that this exerciſe was wholly taken up with my own annihilation. Thereupon I ſaid, <hi>None but the Eternal Father can give to his Son, none but the Father and the Son can give to the Holy Ghoſt; and theſe Preſents made to each other, are Infinite.</hi> There paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them Communications Ineffable, and proportion'd to their Grandeurs. I conſider'd them in my Thoughts, and rejoyced, plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelf in the Abiſs of my own Weakneſs, in that I could do nothing for God, nor give him any thing. The beſt preſent I can make him, is to acknowledge I can give him nothing worth acceptance; and this acknowledgment I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive alſo from the hand of his bounty; 'tis the effect of his Grace, for of my ſelf I cannot do it.</p>
                     <p>O the depth of the Nothing of a Creature! If I ſhould give my Life for God, 'tis leſs then if a <hi>Piſmire</hi> ſhould give hers for a King; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Infinite diſtance between God and a Creature. All the Angels and Saints that ever ſhall raign in Glory can add nothing to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grandeurs. The Abiſs of my Nothing is beyond expreſſion. God only knows it, and I ſee nothing of it but by his Grace. O my God, if all the Angels and Saints are as nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:57606:128"/> you, I that am infinitely below them, what I can give is leſs than nothing.</p>
                     <p>My ſecond Prayer went on in the ſame Thoughts and Conſiderations. And I was much aſtoniſh'd, in that being acquainted with many Perſons, and ſeeing their examples, I was ſo far behind them in Virtue. But looking narrowly into my ſelf, I muſt needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the leaſt pittance of Grace, the leaſt degree of Prayer, the leaſt part I can have in the ſtates of Jeſus, is infinitely above my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, that a Soul inflamed with Divine love is confounded at the ſight of her own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, and ſuffers a kind of Martyrdom. For in that ſhe loves, ſhe would do ſomething for her Beloved, and being conſcious what a Nothing ſhe is of her ſelf, and that ſhe can do nothing; being in ſuſpenſe between will and weakneſs, ſeeing in effect ſhe can do nothing of her ſelf, ſhe breaths ſorth her deſires in ſuch like amorous expreſſions: <hi>If I was God, and you, my God, a Creature, I would willingly be a Creature, that you might be God.</hi> But ſeeing this is an imagination of a thing not poſſible, her Martyrdom of love increaſes, and ſhe lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes in that ſhe loves, and can do nothing for her Beloved. That which comforts her, is, that being able to do nothing for God, ſhe ſees that he is all, and wants nothing; and taking a complacency in this, ſhe repoſes her ſelf quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the boſom of the Divinity, with full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions to abide there for ever.</p>
                     <pb n="230" facs="tcp:57606:129"/>
                     <p> In my third Prayer I apply'd my ſelf to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Divinity it ſelf, without forming any diſtinct thoughts thereof; but though ſo I ſaw nothing, yet I knew God more, then when I ſee him in his Creatures. They are always fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and limited, and therefore the knowledge they afford of God is narrower, than that which I have of him beheld in himſelf. Often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when we apply our ſelves to God to know him, we become ſtupid, and as it were without underſtanding. 'Tis our duty then to give our ſelves up into the hands of God, who does juſtly chaſtiſe us for our ſins, by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing himſelf from us. God is very merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto us to give us patience in this ſtate: During which we muſt continue our Exerciſes of Prayer and Retirement, and reſt as well content with theſe Inſenſibilities and dryneſs, as with illuſtrations from Heaven and guſtful Devotion: ſeeing a Soul in either ſtate is well pleaſing to God.</p>
                     <p>A ſuffering Life is our Portion on Earth, that we may be conform to Jeſus Crucified: For the union with Jeſus Glorified is a Life more proper for ever-Bleſſed Eternity. O my Soul, let us not follow our own Fancy, but ſerve God in what manner he will have us, by a perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of our ſelves to his good pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>The Eternal Song of the Saints in Heaven was the ſubject of my fourth Prayer. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd with great delight, that all the Angels and Glorious Saints ſhall Eternally Glorifie the adorable Trinity with this Sacred Triſagion, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of Sabbath</hi> Me-thought
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:57606:129"/> the firſt of the Seraphins began this Anthem with an admirable Air, and all the Choirs of Angels joyn'd their Voices, all Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a Tone more or leſs elevated, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd to the degree they poſſeſs in Glory: And this innumerable multitude of Angelical Voices made a moſt Melodious and admirable Harmony, wherewith the Divine Perſons were much delighted. It came into my thoughts that the Sacred Humanity of Jeſus Chriſt, the nobleſt of all created Entities, the Sacred Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, Mother of God, and Queen of Angels, with all the multitude of Holy Patriarchs, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Apoſtles, Martyrs, Confeſſors, and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins did bear a part in this Sacred Harmony with great contentment: And my Soul being much delighted therewith, deſir'd to Glorifie God as much as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>I ſaw that the Church Militant in a Holy emulation of the Church Triumphant, did uſe to the Glory of the moſt Sacred Trinity a like Canticle, repeating in her Divine Offices on all occaſions, <hi>Gloria Patri, &amp; Filio, &amp; Spiritui Sancto, Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> And ſo Heaven and Earth did Eccho forth inceſſantly the Glory of the adorable Trinity. I heartily wiſh'd that all Creatures had Voices to Praiſe God continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and with much affection I often repeated, <hi>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Tribus honor unus. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <head>Tenth Day.</head>
                     <p>THis day beginning my Prayer, I felt my Soul prevented with an extraordinary Sweetneſs. I repreſented my God in the fund of my Heart as my Beloved, and I return'd him Thanks for his manifold Viſits. My Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was then as a Spiritual Spring-time, I ſcented the Odour of the Flowers of Virtue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuming my Interiour, and I made thereof a Crown for the Bridegroom of my Soul, and ſet it on his Head, and he ſeem'd to be much pleas'd with it; and my Soul took great complacency therein.</p>
                     <p>I obſerv'd that when the Spiritual Bridegroom comes to Viſit his Spouſe, whether it be in the Holy Communion, or by any Viſit extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, 'tis with different effects. Sometimes the Soul is as it were inebriated with Divine Love: at other times ſhe has a feeling of great variety of Virtues wherewith the Interiour is Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as a Garden with Flowers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Soul is is not then taken up ſolely with the Sweets of Love; but being adorned with variety of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, ſometimes ſhe preſents this, ſometimes that, ſometimes altogether to her Beloved.</p>
                     <p>My ſecond Prayer was a continuation of the ſame Thoughts: And I perceived that every ſtep the Divine Bridegroom of our Souls made in the Garden of his Spouſe, gave a new Birth to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Flowers. This is no ſmall contentment
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:57606:130"/> to the Soul; but what ought moſt to affect her herein, is, that her Beloved is pleas'd to take with her his recreation, who delights to be ſometimes with the Children of men. Then 'tis He refreſhes us with the Perfumes and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of his Graces as Glorified; and we muſt give our ſelves up to his Divine Will.</p>
                     <p>Other times he Viſits a Soul in this Crucified ſtate, bringing with him nothing but Thorns and Nails, and Bitterneſs and Sufferings: But a Soul muſt not think that her Beloved is not then well pleas'd with her becauſe of this rough uſage, for this is his Will and 'tis beſt for her. I was much aſtoniſh'd to ſee the exceſs of Gods goodneſs to me, who deſerv'd to have been treated as an enemy. But he was pleas'd to unite me to himſelf with ſuch raviſhing tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſports, as tranſcend expreſſion: O that I had a heart ſo full of love, as might be anſwerable to the greatneſs of his Mercies vouchſafed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me! O Jeſus, the Love of my Heart, if you continue thus, I ſhall die of Love for you. O amorous flames conſume my heart to aſhes, that nothing may be found there but Love and Humility. O my Friends, come and ſee, what great things God has done for my Soul.</p>
                     <p>My third Prayer was taken up with the ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Communications that the moſt Sacred Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is pleas'd to have with our Souls. The Divine Nature unites the three adorable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Sacred Trinity: The Perſon of the Son unites two Natures in Jeſus: And Grace unites Jeſus to purified Souls: And this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Grace and Love is perfected by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:57606:131"/> of Prayer, and wonderful communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in contemplation. This union ſometimes is ſo high and elevated, that Jeſus and the Soul ſeem to be but one thing, one Spirit, one Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, one Love, and is in a manner the Soul of our Soul. And in this ſtate ſhe Glorifies God in a tranſcendent way, being wonderfully uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that Love and Glory Jeſus renders to the Divinity, and the Divinity to it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>The deſign of the Son of God by communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf to us in the Bleſſed Sacrament, is to augment this gracious union, that, as he Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Father, we may be one, as they are one. By which wonderful union he gives unto us a fulneſs of Grace and Divine Love, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing on us, (unleſs we be refractory,) the like inclinations he received from his Father, to keep us continually united to him by Love; and Honour him with the grateful Sacrifice of our Humiliations.</p>
                     <p>My laſt Prayer was an amorous repoſe of my ſelf in Jeſus. Finding my ſelf in this diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I dwelt upon it, knowing well that a Soul united to Jeſus is transformed into him by amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous affections; and ſo Glorifying God, does Love, and Honour, and Adore the Divinity, by the Love and Adoration of Jeſus Chriſt. The Soul in this amorous repoſe finds all her wants ſupply'd: As Courage in Adverſity, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility in Succeſſes, Perſeverance in Good Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Grace to practice all thoſe Virtues which God commands on all occaſions.</p>
                     <p>By how much the more the Soul is thus amorouſly united to Jeſus in Prayer, by ſo much
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:57606:131"/> the more does ſhe participate of his Spirit and Diſpoſitions, and conſequently is more in love with the <hi>Croſs</hi> and Sufferings. To have union with Jeſus Chriſt in Prayer, and to be divided from him in our Life and Actions, is an illuſion; for one principal effect of pure Prayer, is to imprint in us a love to follow the Life of Jeſus.</p>
                     <p>There now comes into my mind an excellent Obſervation of a Father of the Church; <hi>That the Holy Spirit having viſibly deſcended to us as well as the Son, did not (as the Son,) viſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Heaven, but takes up his Manſion with us here on Earth, to unite our hearts with our Heavenly Father, as in the Divinity he is the union of the Father and the Son.</hi> O Sacred Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Love and Union, what conſolation is it to my Soul, and what encouragement for my weakneſs, that you will vouchſafe to unite my heart to God, from whom you proceed from all Eternity? O Divine Spirit ſo unite me to your ſelf, that I may never forſake you, but depend abſolutely on your conduct. In You, and by You, I adore, I love, and return all poſſible Thanks to the moſt Sacred Trinity, for all Graces and Favours received in this retreat, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>I Entred into this retreat being greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to know Jeſus Chriſt; and my firſt Prayer paſs'd in view of the Incarnation; a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery to be admir'd by Men and Angels to all Et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernity, the ſource of all our Happineſs: A My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery brighter then the morning Star which uſhers in the day to Mortal eyes, by ſhewing to us the Sun of Grace, to enlighten the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Hearts, and Cloath us with Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and Glory: A Myſtery of Mercies, an evidence of the greatneſs of Gods goodneſs to us, Chriſt manifeſted in our fleſh, to die for us: A Myſtery big with wonders, where God is made Man, and Man becomes God by an Hypoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal union.</p>
                     <p>O unſpeakable Myſtery, what Grandeurs and ſecrets are contain'd in Thee above our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding? O Myſtery that brings Heaven upon Earth, that ſcatters our darkneſs, that cures all our evils, that teaches me to know
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:57606:132"/> and love God thus debaſed and annihilated for love of me. O what ſweetneſs do I taſt in this conſideration! What wonders do I diſcover of the goodneſs of God herein beyond all expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? O happy thoſe who know it by experience!</p>
                     <p>Hereafter I will not trouble my ſelf, how I may Love God according to his Goodneſs, or do him Homage according to his Greatneſs, or Praiſe and Adore him according to his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſeeing the only begotten Son of the Father was born of a Virgin-Mother, and gave himſelf to me, to diſcharge theſe Infinite obligations for me. O my Jeſus, ſeeing you have wholly given your ſelf to me, that I might by you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit my Obligations, my care ſhall be to Love God by your Love, to Obey by your Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to Adore by your Adorations. Be you my Light, my Strength, and my Conductor to find you, to know you, to be perfectly united to you in this retreat.</p>
                     <p>In my ſecond Prayer I conſider'd the great Happineſs of the Bleſſed Virgin, in being cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen from all Eternity to be the Mother of the only begotten Son of God. And I ſaid within my ſelf: <hi>Doubtleſs this is the greateſt Favourite of God among all Creatures, enabled with more eminent Graces than any other; for there can be no greater Priviledge or Prerogative Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to a meer Creature, then to be the Mother of God.</hi> How are your Thoughts, O my God, above the Thoughts of Men? You bring your Deſigns about in ways moſt admirable. This moſt excellent of all Creatures, the greateſt Favourite of Heaven, Mother of God, muſt
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:57606:133"/> be Eſpouſed to a Carpenter, a poor Tradeſman, working for his Living: She brings forth her Son, the King of Glory, in a Stable, flies into <hi>Egypt,</hi> lives but poorly, and ſuffers Infinite ſhame and dolours, to ſee her Beloved Jeſus Crucified. Behold the Deſigns of the Eternal Father about this Bleſſed Virgin, whom he had choſen to be the Mother of his only Son.</p>
                     <p>The weakneſs of Humane Reaſon, cannot fathom this. But this is to teach us, to have an eſteem for Poverty, Sufferings, and Abjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſeeing God deals thus with his deareſt Friends. He is pleas'd to put them in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that they may be able to render him the greateſt Love and Service is poſſible upon Earth. To Love God Supernaturally, is to love him at our own expence, and being content with Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for his ſake: A Creature having nothing more to do for God, then to offer to him what he moſt values, namely, his own Intereſt and Satisfactions. O my Soul, do not now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that thou canſt do nothing for God, 'tis enough that thou canſt ſuffer for him. 'Tis no eaſie thing to ſound the depth of this verity.</p>
                     <p>In my third Prayer I was much taken up with the Grandeurs of the Sacred Humanity of Jeſus, being elevated to the Divinity in the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Incarnation, where, by a Perſonal Union it entred into a ſtate of Purity and Love towards the Divinity in ſo tranſcendent a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and ſurpaſſing the underſtanding of Men and Angels, that we are fit for nothing but Adoration. O what Grandeurs were commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the moſt Sacred Humanity in the firſt
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:57606:133"/> Bleſſed moment of the Incarnation? My under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding though enlightned by Faith, found it ſelf loſt in this Ocean of Wonders, and my Will was actuated with an eſteem and Love of Jeſus beyond all expreſſion. Hence ſuch a Joy poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my Soul in knowing Jeſus, with ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and ſatisfaction, that all other knowledges ſeem'd nothing to it; and with St. <hi>Paul, Non aeſtimavi me ſcire aliquid niſi Jeſum, I eſteem'd my ſelf to know nothing but Jeſus, and Him Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I perceived that an amorous union with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, does elevate a Soul to a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful excellency, becauſe it puts us in poſſeſſion of whole Jeſus, his Divinity, his Humanity, his Myſteries, and Verities. For this union is accompanied with a perfect amity, and that makes all things common among Friends. O my Jeſus although I am of my ſelf nothing but Weakneſs and Miſery, being a ſinful Creature; nevertheles I love you with all my heart, and having my part in you, I can ſupply my wants with your Perfections, as belonging to me; and among my Inabilities preſent them to the moſt Sacred Trinity, to acquit my manifold ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations. O how admirable is this union with Jeſus Chriſt! What wonderful benefits does it bring to a Soul, who having nothing of her ſelf, hath all things in him, and by this means be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Infinitely rich!</p>
                     <p>Theſe Thoughts continued yet with me in my fourth Prayer; and I admired Jeſus from the firſt moment of his Birth in his applications towards his Divine Father, to whom he then
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:57606:134"/> offer'd himſelf a Sacrifice, to do him Homage: And in his amiable Communications towards us his poor Brethren, little worms of the Earth. In theſe Diſcoveries I was much troubled that I could not ſerve him by reaſon of my Inabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and could not pleaſe him by reaſon of my Infidelities.</p>
                     <p>O that I was ſo happy as to ſpend my ſelf in his Service, and die with Love! This is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour granted but to ſome ſpecial Favourites: And alas! I am a moſt unworthy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful wretch.</p>
                     <p>At this time methought I heard our Saviour ſpeaking to me, and giving me a ſtrong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his Preſence. O what Happineſs is it to know Jeſus! O what favour is it to find him! What ſweet repoſe finds that Soul, who has a feeling knowledge of Jeſus in her? When this Science of Jeſus appears in her Interiour, all is ſweet and lovely, full of Joy and Peace; and It then ſeems to her, that heretofore ſhe was wandring in darkneſs.</p>
                     <p>In effect it ſeems to her that ſhe now lives in another World, with other Lights, and other Principles, and other Proceeding, and another taſt of Spiritual things. She now ſeeks occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to mortifie her Senſes; obedience, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, contempts, loſſes do reliſh with her, and ſhe's pleas'd only to live a Life of Faith, making no matter of the mockeries of Worldly men, who judge not but by Senſe, or at beſt but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording Humane Reaſon.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>BEginning my Morning Prayer, theſe words of the Prophet were preſented to my Thoughts, <hi>Conſideravi opera tua, &amp; expavi, I have conſidered your Works, O my Saviour, and ſtand amazed with admiration.</hi> And how could I be otherwiſe affected, to ſee the Eternal God an Infant? To ſee that Immenſity which the Heavens cannot contain, lie Swadled in a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? Eternity but one day old? Omnipotency become weakneſs? The joy of Angels in a ſuffering condition? O God of Love, who can but fall into an Extaſie, to ſee theſe wonders, this exceſs of Goodneſs, above the comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Men and Angels? But Bleſſed Saviour, 'tis your Glory to have nothing, and do nothing, but what is altogether incomprehenſible.</p>
                     <p>I obſerv'd a great ſilence in Heaven and Earth, where the whole Creation ſeem'd to be ſtruck dumb with admiration of the great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries then brought to paſs. I beheld how the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and good <hi>Joſeph</hi> fixing their Eyes on the Infant, God-man, lying in a Manger, ſpake not one Word, being tranſported with Love and Admiration, and wholly aſtoniſh'd at an Humiliation ſo Prodigious; and I wonder'd all Creatures did not ſtand immoveable for a whole Age, at the ſight of ſo incomprehenſible
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:57606:135"/> a Myſtery. All Expreſſions are below this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Love and Condeſcention: Let us, O my Soul, be ſilent with a reſpectful attention, love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, adoring, admiring theſe great things God has done for us. Methinks I have a deſire to ſtand always in ſilence at the feet of Infant Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</p>
                     <p>I apply'd my ſelf in my ſecond Prayer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the univerſal denudation of all things that ſeem'd moſt neceſſary at his coming into the World: To be born as an Exile out of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Houſe; to have no lodging uſual for men, but a Stable, which is prepar'd for Beaſts, to be his Bed-chamber, and a Manger for his Cradle, to ſuffer the rigours of Winter for want of Fire; what poor miſerable Creature could be reduced to a greater denudation?</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding this is that which raviſh'd both Heaven and Earth, and the Glorious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels found nothing in Heaven of equal admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and therefore hither they came to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template theſe wonders, and to bring the glad tidings thereof to men, making the Air to eccho with their joyful Melody, and without any mention of the Divinity, declare only to them, that they ſhall find an Infant wrapt in ſwadling Cloaths, lying in a Manger: And hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Shepherds ran tranſported with Joy, and the World has followed them.</p>
                     <p>When the Wiſe men demanded of <hi>Herod, Where he was born who was King of the</hi> Jews, This <hi>Idaea</hi> of Royalty did much afright him, and in rage he deſign'd a Cruelty more Barbarous than what as yet the <hi>Sun</hi> did ever behold. 'Tis a
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:57606:135"/> great Truth, that Grandeur and an elevated condition (though in the Perſon of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf made man,) is attended with many evils and commotions; but abjection and Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Infant Jeſus has force enough to win our hearts. And yet we will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this.</p>
                     <p>In my third Prayer I diſcover'd, that ſince the Myſtery of the Incarnation, which is the wonderful union of the Creator with the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then Sons of men are called to a higher degree of Prayer and Converſe with God then formerly. The gift of ſublime Prayer is one effect of this Divine Myſtery, and we ought to value and preſerve it as a Treaſure. The heart of Jeſus is the center of men; and when a poor Soul is diſtracted, ſhe muſt gently lead her ſelf to the heart of Jeſus, to offer to the Eternal Father the holy diſpoſitions of that adorable heart, to unite that little we do with that Infinite ſervice Jeſus renders to his Eternal Father. Thus our little will be made great by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>O my Soul, let this Divine heart of Jeſus for the future be thy Oratory. 'Tis in him and by him thou muſt offer all thy Prayers to God, to make them acceptable to the Divine Majeſty. Make this thy School, to learn there the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent knowledge of the Love of God, which is quite contrary to that of the World. Thou wilt find there Principles ſublime and pure; a Treaſure which will enrich thee with Purity, Love and Fidelity; and what is very plentiful in this Treaſury, Humiliations, Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Sufferings. The love and eſteem of
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:57606:136"/> theſe things is a precious Jewel, which princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally and originally is found in the heart of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. Other hearts, how noble ſoever, have more or leſs of it, according to the meaſure they receive from this exhauſtible Treaſury.</p>
                     <p>In my fourth Prayer I had a ſtrong <hi>Idaea</hi> of the diſpoſitions, which the Bleſſed Virgin and St. <hi>Joſeph</hi> had towards the Infant Jeſus. 'Twas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to a Holy Soul, that the Bleſſed Virgin paſſed all the time in Prayer, while her Sacred Womb was the Tabernacle of the Son of God, and never ceas'd to adore the Word made Fleſh. That St. <hi>Joſeph</hi> entring with the Holy Virgin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Stable at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> was elevated in high contemplation upon the Myſteries there to be Accompliſh'd; and in this Prayer was ſo reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the Holy Spirit, that his deſires for the coming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> were more pure and more ardent, then of all the Holy Patriarchs before: And that next to the Holy Virgin he was enlightned with the wonders of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Incarnation.</p>
                     <p>At the moment of the wonderful Nativity of the Infant Jeſus, ſuch Rayes of Glory and admirable Splendors were darted from his Soul, as pierced the Spirit of the Bleſſed Virgin and St. <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and diſcover'd to them the Infinite Grandeurs of that <hi>Babe,</hi> through all the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes their eyes were witneſs of. And in deep ſilence and contemplation, they offer'd to him a pure and amorous offering of their whole Being, as to their God. O who can compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the wonderful effects, that his preſence caus'd in their Hearts? Theſe conſiderations did
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:57606:136"/> ſweetly poſſeſs my Soul during my Prayer; and I found my ſelf in a diſpoſition of great Love for Internal Prayer, in Silence and Solitude with Infant-Jeſus.</p>

                     <head>Third Day. <hi>Jeſus Poor and Abject.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IN my Morning Prayer I found in my ſelf a great eſteem and love for Poverty, ſeeing Jeſus had ſo eſteem'd and lov'd it, and we have an obligation to be conform to him. And I ſaid within my ſelf: O Poverty of Spirit, what riches doſt thou bring to a Soul? Thou giveſt her poſſeſſion of a Kingdom of Peace: Thou doſt purifie her, to unite her to Jeſus in his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations, which gives her a right to the riches of Glory; for Truth hath ſaid it, <hi>Bleſſed are the Poor in Spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O how a Soul, which once hath beheld the Beauties of Holy Poverty, is ready to follow Jeſus poor and abject, and conform her ſelf to his example? She finds her ſelf freed of her Fetters, which keep men Captives and Slaves to the World; and it ſeems to her to be depriv'd of all Creatures, is the greateſt Treaſure upon Earth. She growes rich by her loſſes; and when God will have her to poſſeſs Goods and Honours, 'tis yet with a diſpoſition to quit them, and poſſeſs God alone. She therefore only keeps
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:57606:137"/> them by a pure dependance on the Divine Will, without an eſteem or love for them, but loves in them ſolely the Will of God. Theſe were the impreſſions my firſt Prayer made in me.</p>
                     <p>In my ſecond Prayer I continued to conſider the poor and abject ſtates of Jeſus Chriſt. God in his Eternal Decrees had a love for the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ways of the Word Incarnate. Thoſe Souls, who are favour'd with Illuſtrations from Heaven, are ſtrongly carried the ſame way, diſcerning clearly that they can do nothing better upon Earth than to tread the footſteps of God himſelf. To this end the Divine Wiſdom elevates them above themſelves and their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclinations, to conduct them ſolely by the inſtincts of Grace; whereby they make a glorious conqueſt over the weakneſs of Nature, Self-love, and Carnal Prudence, which ſtand in the way to Chriſtian Perfection, and hinder us from following Jeſus in his Abjections.</p>
                     <p>It highly concerns us to die daily to the World, that we may attain to the Purity of Divine Love, that is, Poſſeſs and Love God alone: The Pride of <hi>Adam</hi> will not die in us, unleſs we be content to follow Jeſus in his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections. O my Soul, let us fall in Love with this ſtate of Jeſus Chriſt, which is little known to the World, and take it for a Soveraign fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from Heaven, to become ſo contemptible for Gods ſake, as to paſs for one hardly good for any thing. O Jeſus, how few Companions have you of your extreme Poverty? Many Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour this Virtue in you, but few practice it. They muſt be Faithful Friends indeed who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:57606:137"/> you in theſe ways, ſo bitter and diſtaſtful to Fleſh and Blood. O Jeſus, be Merciful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, and grant me this Fidelity, that I may never forſake you in Life, nor Death.</p>
                     <p>My third Prayer was taken up with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral view of the Humiliations of the Son of God, for which I felt my Soul had much Love and Reſpect. Theſe Divine Humiliations did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh me beyond compariſon, and I diſcover'd ſuch wonderful Beauty in them, that I could not be ſatisfied with beholding them. I was deeply poſſeſs'd with a deſire to conform my ſelf to Jeſus in his Humiliations, and to ſpend my days in his imitation; and I was much troubled, I could not yet quit all things, to live a poor, abject, retir'd life. 'Tis no leſs the work of Grace, to bring us to reliſh the Abjections of Jeſus Chriſt, as to be taken with his Grandeurs: His Grandeurs are incomprehenſible; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in my eyes ſeem more great and rich, and precious than his Humiliations.</p>
                     <p>The unſpeakable Love that Jeſus Chriſt has for Souls, does manifeſt it ſelf by making them partakers of his Humiliations. Be content, O my Soul, with what part he ſhall give thee: For it ſeems to me a puniſhment, to abound with Riches and Honours, whereby we become unlike to Jeſus, and march on in ways contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his practice and example. When I reflect upon my ſins, I cannot ſufficiently admire the great Graces God is pleas'd to vouchſafe me. A ſtrong argument to convince of his Infinite goodneſs, and affords much matter of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, conſidering how unworthy I am of the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:57606:138"/> leaſt favours. But for me a poor wretch, to have a call to ſolitude, to converſe only with God and his Holy Angels, what a Mercy is this?</p>
                     <p>It came into my mind that <hi>Moſes,</hi> who had been a Captain of Thieves, was afterwards a Holy <hi>Hermit;</hi> and I had a ſpecial Devotion to him, deſiring him to help me by his Prayers. O the wonderful effects of Grace, that a Robber ſhould become a <hi>Hermit!</hi> I have a Devotion to Saints that have been great ſinners, methinks they are Powerful with God, to help ſinners to be converted.</p>
                     <p>This view of the extreme humiliations of Jeſus yet continuing, was the ſubject of my fourth Prayer: And I found in my ſelf great deſires to begin a new kind of life, to give my ſelf abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to God as a Sacrifice, by dying to all things of the world by a vow of Poverty. But I being not yet in a condition to forſake my tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral affairs, I reſolv'd to make ſuch a Vow when all things were ſettled; and I took care that my affairs might be ſo regulated, as to put me in a condition to comply with the call of God.</p>
                     <p>Having taken this reſolution, I found my heart inflamed with deſires to be wholly for God; and to conform my ſelf as much as poſſible to Jeſus in his humiliations. Nature felt ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting reſentment hereat, and furniſh'd me with arguments to divert me from it: But the light of Grace ſcatter'd theſe thoughts, and taught me to neglect the help of Creatures, by caſting my ſelf wholly into the arms of his Providence. O my Jeſus! the only love of my Soul, though the moſt deſpiſed of men, your Divine attracts
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:57606:138"/> and inſpirations do ſo powerfully invite me to follow you in your ways of poverty, that I ſhall never ſoon enough ſee the happy moment to engage my ſelf thereto, by a Vow never to be recalled.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="4" type="day">
                     <head>Fourth Day. <hi>Jeſus, the Fountain of Grace and Piety.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IN my firſt Prayer God gave me to ſee the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite grandeurs of the Sacred Humanity united to the Divinity in the ſame perſon. This ineffable union was the general and amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous object of my regard, which wrought in my Soul a very great eſteem, and ſingular love and union with Jeſus Chriſt. This ſtate of Jeſus rejoyced my heart, and I dwelt upon it, my Soul being ſatisfied with wonderful content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I had interiour aſſurances, and very great certitudes of the Divinity of Jeſus; nothing in him ſeemed dark unto me, though all ſurpaſſed the ſtrength of reaſon. I beheld him as the Principal of Grace and Glory. This manifeſtation was in me by a Divine light, and I found it filled my heart with moſt pleaſing impreſſions.</p>
                     <p>The ſmall conviction we have of the Divinity of Jeſus, makes us ſuch cold Chriſtians, and that we walk ſo ſlowly in the ways of Grace. For who firmly believes that Jeſus is God, will have a ſingular eſteem of his Doctrine, of his Counſels, of his Proceedings, and think it his
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:57606:139"/> Glory for to follow him. The perfect belief of the Divinity of Jeſus, carries a Soul to real en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours after perfection, to deſpiſe the world, to take up the Croſs, and follow Jeſus in his abjections. This is to be the Image of Jeſus Chriſt. The poorer we are in Spirit, the richer we are in Grace; the more a Soul is nothing in her ſelf, the more God is all in her, and is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to work great things for her.</p>
                     <p>Jeſus preſented himſelf to my ſpirit in my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Prayer, diſcovering to me in general the different ſtates of his life; paſſive in his Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, active in Virtues, and how he is the Origen and Source of all purity, to which we aſpire by a ſpiritual life.</p>
                     <p>I conceiv'd, firſt, That there's a purity of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, which is great indeed, when we ſuffer without ſeeking relief; carrying this Croſs for God's ſake as long as he pleaſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is a purity of action, when we act not (whether interiourly or exteriourly) but by the motion of God's ſpirit, with pure intentions. Here arguments of humane reaſon are cut off, and we ſtir not without ſome impreſſions of Grace, working only for God by his working in us. We muſt labour hard, and be perfectly dead to the world, before we can come to this ſtate of purity.</p>
                     <p>There's a purity of intention, when we have only an eye to the will of God, to do what pleaſes him, without acting upon other Motives, though good and laudable, wherein ſeems to be ſome ſelf-intereſt; as, <hi>fear to offend; to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God's call, to be more loved and rewarded.</hi>
                        <pb n="251" facs="tcp:57606:139"/> A Soul in this ſtate has no regard to her ſelf, but ſolely to the will of God, her End and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                     <p>There's a purity of imployment, when a Soul will not divert her thoughts from God, but by Order from God himſelf, by ſome motion of his holy Spirit. Hence we ſhun unneceſſary viſits, unprofitable words, ſuperfluous occupations; and that is ſuperfluous to one Soul, which is not to another, by reaſon of the different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Grace imparted to them. We muſt ſuffer many mortifications to attain this purity; and ſuch a Soul muſt fear nothing more than Infidelity. This is but a branch of the purity of action.</p>
                     <p>There's a purity of Virtue, when we practice only what God will have us to do. There's a purity of ſpiritual delight, when the ſuperiour part of the Soul receives no conſolations wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly from any Creature, or ſenſual things, but ſtands upon her guard to keep them out. And there's a purity of Prayer, when the Soul (eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above her ſelf by the workings of God in her) is in extaſie of ſpirit, and united to God alone by contemplation.</p>
                     <p>A Soul that once has had a feeling of God in her, ſees an infinite difference between Him and the holieſt Creatures; and entring into a great interiour ſolitude, converſes with God alone. All theſe ſorts of purity appeared to me in the Interiour of Jeſus, as in their Source.</p>
                     <p>In my third Prayer I came to know that the myſteries or ſtates of Jeſus Chriſt are not only the exemplar, but alſo the efficient of our ſtates;
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:57606:140"/> ſo that we ſuffer, not only to imitate Jeſus in his ſufferings, but becauſe Jeſus by his ſufferings imprints on us the virtue of his ſpirit to give us the grace to ſuffer for him. When we pray, 'tis not only to imitate Jeſus in contemplation, but becauſe he infuſes into our hearts the gift of Prayer by his holy Spirit. And if a Soul arrive to that heighth, as to poſſeſs Jeſus Chriſt in an extraordinary manner, he then does all in her, and for her, ſhe being only pliable to his Divine Operations. We cannot continue in this ſtate without wonderful purity; the leaſt ſally of immortified Nature will much endamage it.</p>
                     <p>How often has God been pleas'd to give me experience of this, when Jeſus uniting himſelf unto me in the holy Communion, annihilates all my thoughts, words and affections, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to me all things in me! He is my Thankfulneſs, my Offering, my Humility, my Charity, my Prayers; and I do nothing, but remain united to him, who works all for my Soul, as it were, annihilated in his preſence. Words as well as thoughts fail us in the preſence of the WORD, who pleads to his Fathers for thoſe Souls he poſſeſſes in ſuch a myſterious manner. What marvels are there hidden beyond expreſſion?</p>
                     <p>In my fourth Prayer I conſider'd, that being a Chriſtian, I had a ſtrict obligation to follow Chriſt: but beſides that general tie, I had a ſpecial vocation to imitate Jeſus in his humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. To follow him in this way with purity, I muſt forſake all grandeur, and be content with poverty and objection, and labour ſtoutly for
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:57606:140"/> a perfect abnegation of my ſelf. Since God has given me a generous reſolution, to ſacrifice my ſelf wholly to his ſervice, I will follow his call, though I die for't. Methinks I am enabl'd to do it with great peace and liberty of Spirit. What evil can happen to me, if I die for God, who died for Me?</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who chooſe to be poor, out of deſire to follow Jeſus, are peculiar Objects of God's care and providence, which extends it ſelf to all men, but eſpecially to thoſe who are the lively Images of his Son. He is their Father in a peculiar manner, and ſets a watch about them more than others. For is it poſſible he ſhould not give Bread to them, who leave all their Temporals, to ſerve him better, and love him purer? Let us ſtifle all humane reaſonings on this ſubject; let us go whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Grace calls us, and fear nothing: If we die in the ſervice, 'twill be happy for us. 'Tis a great favour from God, when we breath out our Souls in the flames of Divine Love.</p>

                  <div n="5" type="day">
                     <head>Fifth Day. <hi>Jeſus, Zelator of Souls.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IN my firſt Prayer I apply'd my ſelf to Jeſus, as <hi>Zelator of Souls,</hi> for whom he gave his moſt precious Blood. I beheld, what I could not comprehend, that this Zeal of Jeſus for the good of Souls was infinite. It ſeemed to me,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:57606:141"/> that my Soul receiv'd ſome ſmall portion of this holy Zeal, and I was powerfully inclin'd to lay out my ſelf for my Neighbours good, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering my ſelf to God, to do and ſuffer what he pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>But I perceiv'd this Zeal for Souls muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into us; we muſt not run before we be ſent, otherwiſe we ſhall neither do good for others, nor our ſelves, but diſturb our Interiour, and commit many diſorders. When this Zeal is kindled in our Souls by the breathing of God's holy Spirit, it puts nothing out of order, but we go in Perfection, and advance in Prayer. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, all muſt be regulated by Prudence, leſt we out-run our call, and hurt our ſelves, while we would do good to others.</p>
                     <p>For our care muſt be to procure the good of others, according to the grace conferred upon us. Some in an active life, by Preaching and Inſtructing: ſome by works of corporal Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: others by offering up to God their contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative life, their Solitudes, their Auſterities, their Sufferings, their Prayers. There are many ways to be inſtrumental for the good of others. Let every one imploy his proper talent.</p>
                     <p>Our bleſſed Saviour being near his Paſſion, left us as a Legacy this divine Commandment, <hi>Love ye one another, as I have loved you,</hi> which was the ſubject of my ſecond Prayer. I then found, that when a Soul has made a good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the heart of Jeſus Chriſt, and by the light of Prayer ſees the infinite love of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, Grace then diſcovers how this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine charity is free, generous, and magnificent.
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:57606:141"/> Free, having a love for us when objects of his juſt diſpleaſure. Generous, ſurmounting all difficulties, and conquering all reſiſtances. Magnificent, in giving his own life for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. This is a Zeal truly Divine for the Salvation of Souls.</p>
                     <p>Now his pleaſure is that the charity we have for our Neighbour be regulated by this divine Model, that we love them to do the will of God, and obey his Commands. That we love them generouſly, without any regard to natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral averſions, or injuries they have done us, or any temporal advantages we may receive from them; but after the example of Jeſus, to love and do good even to our greateſt enemies. O how many great Saints, conſidering the ardent love of Chriſt to us, have burn'd with the flames of a holy Zeal, and ſpent themſelves in labours, to do good to thoſe Souls for whom Chriſt died! But (alas!) we have little zeal for God, for our Neighbour, or our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>My third Prayer paſſed in conſiderations of the prodigious goodneſs of Jeſus to men, who ſeem'd to forget himſelf, and depoſe the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deurs of his Majeſty, to debaſe himſelf in the ſearch of our Souls; to indulge and love them with as much affection, as if they did contribute to his felicity. He prevents them with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful mercies, and though they be unworthy of his love, he gives them ſenſible feelings thereof, by ſpeaking to the heart in this, or ſuch-like manner: <hi>My Sister, my Spouſe, my love takes a delight in thee; knoweſt thou well who I am? 'Tis I that am thy God, thy Creator,</hi>
                        <pb n="256" facs="tcp:57606:142"/> 
                        <hi>thy Saviour: 'Tis I, who came from the boſom of my Father into this world, to find thee, being loſt, and tell thee how I love thee, and I demand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but love again.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>My Soul thus prevented with the bleſſings of this ſweetneſs, and powerfully touched with a ſenſe thereof, wanted words to expreſs my thankfulneſs: However, I ſaid, <hi>O my God! You are my love; I love you, and will love you eternally, with all my heart; for what elſe have I to return, but love for love? 'Tis a wonderful love for you to debaſe the grandeurs of your Divinity, to ſearch after poor ſinful Souls: Nor is it leſs wonderful for you to draw theſe Souls out of themſelves, to free them from their miſeries, and advance them to your embraces, and place them in your heart as ſome rich Treaſure. This is the wonderful exceſs of the love of Jeſus Zelator of Souls.</hi> This love that ſo humbled Jeſus, does elevate a Soul to theſe amorous exerciſes, and makes her ſee her own unworthineſs, and the incomparable beauty of her well-beloved.</p>
                     <p>In my fourth Prayer I had a deep impreſſion of Jeſus humbled, and doing Penance for us. I beheld him as it were annihilated in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his eternal Father, to honour his eternal Beeing, by ſacrificing his humanity, which he continued his whole life, and conſummated on the Croſs. I beheld alſo, how being charged with our ſins, he did continual Penance for us, to ſatisfie the divine Juſtice, and give content to that infinite love he has for our Souls.</p>
                     <p>Let us love then, O my Soul, our Jeſus, as he has loved us, and imitate his ſufferings by a ſpirit
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:57606:142"/> of penance and annihilation. I am a great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and therefore ought to entertain a ſpirit of penance, and thereby make advantage of all evils and infirmities which happen to me. My principal affair in this world ought to be to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate my ſelf, and to ſuffer; to annihilate my ſelf, to pay homage to the infinite grandeurs of God, and to ſuffer, as a juſt puniſhment of my ſins.</p>
                     <p>After Confeſſion, having but one <hi>Gloria Patri</hi> for my penance, it came into my thoughts, that no penance is little when 'tis united to the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Jeſus Chriſt, who by them has done penance for our ſins. It ſeemed to me, that one only <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> united to the ſufferings of the Son of God, which are of infinite merit, and did infinitely ſatisfie his eternal Father, becomes a penance which wonderfully ſatisfies for our ſins. My Soul was comforted with this truth, and I had no more to do, than to unite my little Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to the Croſs of Jeſus.</p>

                     <head>Sixth Day. <hi>Jeſus, contemplating and enjoying.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>OUr bleſſed Saviour did fill my Soul with ſuch ſuper-abundant conſolation in my mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Prayer, that I ſeem'd to have ſome part of that ſtate of enjoyment which is reſerv'd for the Saints in Glory. O amorous enjoyment! how wonderfully doſt thou purifie our Souls!
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:57606:143"/> Thou takeſt our hearts off from the World, thou doſt Crucifie us with a delightful Martyrdom, thou doſt enlighten, thou doſt purifie, thou doſt inflame, thou doſt mortifie, thou doſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie, thou makeſt us live and die together.</p>
                     <p>A ſmall taſt of this Ocean of delights will inebriate the Souls of men, and the Angels in Glory. This is that Bleſſed Life which is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſome Servants of God, honouring him by continual enjoyments, which he pours into their Souls. 'Tis a great ſecret of the Interiour Life, to be paſſive to the operations of God in us, whether he viſits us with dolorous and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying, or joyful and beatifying impreſſions. Our fidelity conſiſts in a pure correſpondence to his deſigns without reluctance. If he pleaſe to make our Soul a Garden of Delights, embrace his Favours. All the ways of God are good in themſelves, but that which he puts us in, is beſt for us. O how the ſtate of Jeſus ſuffering, is adorable! O how his ſtate of enjoying is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable! We muſt apply our ſelves to one or other, according to the deſigns of the Divine Wiſdom.</p>
                     <p>I found an Image of Jeſus in Contemplation, his Look and Poſture raviſh'd me, and this took up my ſecond Prayer. I was not ſatisfied with beholding his Divine Aſpect, I admir'd and ador'd him. Conſidering the profound attention he had to the Grandeurs of his Eternal Father, and how he was abſorp'd in the Divinity, I made it my work to contemplate alſo by him, and in him, uniting my ſelf to the utmoſt of my Power to his Divine entertainments. O Jeſus
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:57606:143"/> contemplating! Jeſus taken up with your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with whom you paſs in Prayer whole nights made as bright as the days of Eternity! Jeſus living a retir'd life in the Divine Eſſence! You are the object of my Love, I ſee nothing ſo beautiful as you are in this ſtate.</p>
                     <p>My Soul hath no greater delight upon Earth, than to have an eye to Jeſus, to think of him, to ſpeak of him, to ſigh after him. O how happy is that Soul, which Jeſus makes his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? I know not how Jeſus comes into a Soul, but he's there ſometimes ſooner then perceiv'd, filling her with Bleſſings, and making her to find, that he is her repoſe and true Felicity. Alas! when ſhall it be that Jeſus poſſeſſes my Soul, ſo as never to leave me? This is what I ſigh after, and I will purchaſe it at any rate. So to poſſeſs Jeſus is a Heaven upon earth, and all we have is too little to gain it. Come, O dear Jeſus, and make my Heart your Manſion for ever: Of all your Graces and Favours, I only deſire you to be always preſent with me, and that I make it my buſineſs ſo to ſerve you, as in ſome ſort to be made partaker of thoſe admirable diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your contemplative Life.</p>
                     <p>I then had a ſight of the Infinite difference between the ſervice of Jeſus, between the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual, and a Spiritual Life. This cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; unleſs Jeſus imprint his Maxims, his Spirit and Sentiments in our hearts, which will enable us to Crucifie our Senſuality, and obey his motions.</p>
                     <p>I obſerv'd that my Devotion to the Sacred Humanity increas'd daily, and felt in my Soul
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:57606:144"/> ſuch Powerful attracts, that no ſooner was I in a Praying poſture, but Jeſus poſſeſs'd my heart, and diſcover'd ſomething of his Grandeurs to me. This Grace I received from his goodneſs in my third Prayer. After which me thought I knew Jeſus Chriſt in a new manner; who though inacceſſable to the Creature, by reaſon of his Divine and Infinite Perfections, yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he does moſt clearly manifeſt himſelf to ſpecial Favourites. Such a view of Jeſus is more to be valued than the whole World; and a Soul that once has been vouchſafed this Grace, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteems her ſelf ſo rich, that ſhe looks upon all Worldly things as droſs and dung, adhering cloſe to Jeſus as her only Treaſure. We can never know what admirable effects this ſight of Jeſus works in a Soul, but by experience.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, there's a great deal of difference between the Viſions of Jeſus. A Soul in the beginning of a Spiritual Life is taken up with the ſenſible part of the Sacred Humanity, but in the progreſs ſhe receives ſuch pure diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Jeſus, that ſhe only reliſhes Jeſus whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Divinized, but cannot expreſs what ſhe ſees in him. Souls thus diſpos'd, receive much of the Spirit of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and his humane ſtates ſeem to them ſo elevated and tranſcendent, that they find nothing more beautiful, more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or more charming to win their Affections. O that we did know Jeſus as he ought to be known! O that we could ſee the ineſtimable riches, the rare and precious Treaſures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in him!</p>
                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:57606:144"/>
                     <p> My fourth Prayer was only to open the eyes of my Soul, to ſee Jeſus Chriſt, as we behold any Object with the eyes of our Body, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it attentively. He was pleas'd ſo to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt himſelf to my Soul, as my joy was ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabundant, and I was dead to all things, and my ſelf, to live in Jeſus, and love his Beauties. I found my ſelf in a manner like a drunken man; who is not himſelf, but as a dead man; he knows not what he ſays, nor is capable of any buſineſs, nor can govern himſelf; his drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs has poſſeſs'd him, and made him fit for nothing elſe.</p>
                     <p>Enjoyment, for the time it continues, has the like effects in a Soul, ſhe is then capable of nothing but this enjoyment, which is all in all unto her. Such Souls are now and then put upon the rack by themſelves or their directors, fearing leaſt this may ſavour of idleneſs. They think it may be better to ſuffer, and more profitable to help their Neighbour, and that ſelf-love may creep into this enjoyment: This ſometimes brings a Soul to quit this enjoyment, ſo as to put her ſelf out of the way where God has plac'd her, except ſome particular Grace preſerve her in the performance of Gods will.</p>
                     <p>A Soul capable of this Grace muſt be in a ſtate of great Purity, diſengaged and dead to all things Exteriour and Interiour, indifferent to all Divine Ordinations whatever, and be in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect diſpoſition to adhere to God, and his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine operations in what manner he pleaſes. O how great is our humane weakneſs! O how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten do we reſiſt the Deſigns of God by our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections?</p>

                     <head>Seventh Day. <hi>Jeſus our Exemplar and Guide.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IN my firſt Prayer I conſider'd how Jeſus was a ſcandal to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> fooliſhneſs; that the ſame Perſon ſhould be God and Man, and die upon a <hi>Croſs</hi> to ſave the World, the belief of this ſeem'd a pure extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancy to poor, blinded Creatures. I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd alſo how a true Supernatural Chriſtian Life ſeems but as folly to Worldly-wiſe-men, who cannot underſtand it, being elevated above ſenſe and humane reaſon, wholly Spiritual and repugnant to the Inclinations of depriv'd na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Alas! how the practice of the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Life is rare? To love croſſes, and contempts, and poverty, and humiliations, and to rejoyce in Perſecutions, by preferring the Maxims of Faith before humane Wiſdom, is a proceeding very extraordinary to Carnal men, who in a manner are wholly guided by their Senſes. If Grace do not open the eyes of Faith in us, our poor Soul has no director but Reaſon which caſts a miſt before us, to hinder our ſight from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Verities.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Grace alſo diſcover'd to me, that as Jeſus lived a Suffering Life, we likewiſe ſhould conform to his ſtates, and be content with croſſes and contrarieties, pains and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and be pleas'd with whatſoever comes
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57606:145"/> from the hand of God: The poor, retir'd, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Life I reſolv'd to lead, anſwerable to my Vocation, without doubt will be accounted a folly by Worldly men, and may ſometimes ſo ſeem to my ſelf. But take courage, O my Soul, a lively Faith will diſcover the deceit by a Light from Heaven. The Proceedings of a Spiritual Life are not govern'd by Humane Arguments, but Divine and Supereminent Motives: For we muſt ſuffer, to do Penance, and we muſt love Poverty, to advance pure Love, which deſpiſes all things to have God in poſſeſſion.</p>
                     <p>In my ſecond Prayer I clearly ſaw, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus took no pleaſure without neceſſity, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe ſuch rough Maxims to us. He knew that the corruption of our Nature was great, our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to things of this World was continual, and therefore to live in his Love, requir'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Mortifications and Contradictions to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And the degree of Love is according to the degree of Self-denyal and Mortification. Jeſus hath founded Chriſtian Perfection upon two high Mountains, <hi>Calvary</hi> and <hi>Tabor;</hi> on the one we learn Perfection and Mortification, on the other the Perfection of Prayer; and on both the Sublimity of Divine Love.</p>
                     <p>To follow Jeſus Chriſt upon one or th'other mountain, we muſt die to the World, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver let the love of the Croſs and Mortification to languiſh in us. Solitude muſt be dear to ſuch Souls, and they muſt take no imploy but what God will have them; leaſt intereſſing themſelves, and ſpending their Spirits in other matters, they make themſelves unable to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:57606:146"/> vigorouſly the works of their Vocation. My Soul, would it not be a ſad thing to quit thy Creator and Redeemer? to lay out thy ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Creature, and not correſpond to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations, who calls thee to himſelf? What a horrible Infidelity would this be? Let us not grieve the Holy Spirit, by whom we are Sealed to the day of Redemption.</p>
                     <p>The ſubject of my third Prayer was the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Oeconomy of the Incarnation, in that by the exceſs of Love and Goodneſs, God was made Man, and Man became God. I had profound veneration for the adorable Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty abſorpt in the Divinity, and with an amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous confidence beheld the Divinity as it were annihilated in the Humanity, which ſeem'd to me as a Tabernacle of Honour, where God dwelt with Infinite Delight: This Humanity alſo in a manner diviniz'd, takes Infinite Delight in the Divinity; from whence it receives won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Impreſſions of Annihilation, to be poor, abject and deſpis'd, Crucified. For after God was made man, he inſpir'd the Humanity with ardent deſires and love of Sufferings for us Men and our Salvation.</p>
                     <p>O Jeſus, when you communicate your ſelf to a Soul, ſhe receives impreſſions from you, which incline her to a love of Contempts and Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. And when a Soul feels in her ſelf the greateſt propenſion to Sufferings and Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal, 'tis then ſhe moſt participates of your communications, and has the greateſt aſſurance of them. For O good Jeſus, your Spirit is full of ſuch impreſſions from the Divinity, and the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:57606:146"/> Soul where you reign as King, does Infallibly receive the like impreſſions from your preſence.</p>
                     <p>In my fourth Prayer I was touch'd with a great deſire to leave this Mortal Life, ſo full of Sin and Miſery, and depriv'd of the Beatifical Viſion of God my Saviour. Oh how irkſom is it, not to be in a capacity to contemplate at leaſure this Infinite Beauty, this Eſſence full of Infinite Perfections, this only true Object of the Loves of Heaven and Earth? O when ſhall I be deliver'd from this Priſon of Fleſh, that I may behold Jeſus the Light of my Eyes, and Joy of my Heart? Muſt I yet continue longer in this baniſhment? What a croſs is it to live here? What a puniſhment is the delay? Death, how welcom wilt thou be in my embraces?</p>
                     <p>We muſt languiſh with Love after the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Beauty of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſigh to enjoy him. O my Soul, do not amuſe thy ſelf with Creatures, love the <hi>Croſs,</hi> which is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to Happineſs. Is it poſſible to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and Love him, and to languiſh with Deſires to enjoy Him? To ſtand much in fear of Death, is a ſign we have little deſire to ſee the Infinite Beauties of God, ſeeing Death only opens the gate of Paradice. O Death, thou art deſirable, come, and put me in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Object of my Love, that I may live with Jeſus who is the ſource of Life, and the joy of the Bleſſed. In the <hi>interim,</hi> O my Soul, let us have neither Love nor Life, nor operation, but what is in him, and for him, our Soveraign Happineſs. <hi>Vivit in me Chriſtus.</hi>

                     <head>Eighth Day. <hi>Jeſus our Light.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>JEſus was preſent to me in my firſt Prayer, as the Light of the World, which diſcover'd to me ſuch a Beauty in the Myſteries of our Religion, with rayes of a new Light, that I ſaw more then ever the vanity of the World, and the ſtrange Sottiſhneſs of ſuch men, who preferr'd the Darkneſs of Falſehood before the Light of Truth. <hi>Inſanias falſas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The beams of this Light works wonders in a Soul, for it leaves ſuch impreſſions as bring her to know Truth in another manner then by the ſole Light of Reaſon or Faith either. If we be in the Cloſet of ſome great King in the dark, we know well there be excellent pieces there; we may know their number, bigneſs, and value of the Precious Stones, the rareneſs of the Painting, and what elſe we ſee not: But when once the leaſt light of day appears, then we begin to have a view of all their Riches, Beauties, and Excellencies, and the whole order of the Cloſet ſalutes our eyes, and in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration thereof, we are taken with it in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary manner.</p>
                     <p>When it pleaſes God to give us a ſight of his Divine Beauties, diſcovering them to a Soul by the leaſt Ray of his Heavenly Light, then the Soul is wonderfully affected, and being more
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:57606:147"/> then ever tranſported with admiration, looks upon all things of the World as nothing. Faith indeed gives us a certain aſſurance of her Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but leaves in obſcurity: But one ſole Ray from the Eyes of Jeſus, when he is pleas'd to dart it into a Soul, doth confirm, fortifie, encourage, and refreſh her with Illuſtrations extraordinary, and Soveraign conſolations. <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedite ad eum, &amp; illuminamini, We cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to Jeſus, and not be enlightned.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I came to know in my ſecond Prayer, that when Jeſus is pleas'd to manifeſt himſelf to a Soul, he infuſes a Light into her, which gives her a marvellous Facility to believe the Verities of the Word Incarnate. She has a certainty, and as it were experience, that his Thoughts, his Words, his Actions, his Proceedings, his Doctrine, his Sufferings were Divine, and brought a Soveraign Honour to the Divinity. O Science of Jeſus, how art thou ſweet and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable? All other knowledge in reſpect of thee is but ignorance and vanity.</p>
                     <p>I have by the great goodneſs of God had ſome little experience to know Jeſus in this manner, but I cannot expreſs it. The more this knowledge increaſes, the leſs is it explicable. The profound attention to Jeſus does ſo take up my Spirit, that it takes away my Speech: It calls me from all Creatures, to converſe with him alone, and draws me out of my ſelf, to be raviſh'd with him.</p>
                     <p>O World! how blind art thou, not to ſee the Beauty of the Poor and abject ſtates of Jeſus! His Doctrine and his Maxims are the only true
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:57606:148"/> Light: All that thou haſt, O ignorant World, ſeduced by the Prince of Darkneſs, is but meer Darkneſs, thy opinions, thy imployments, thy hopes, thy fears, thy deſires, thy entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are but Darkneſs and diſorder; thou ſtumbleſt almoſt at every ſtep, becauſe thou walkeſt in Darkneſs, out of which thou canſt never get but by Jeſus Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For as the <hi>Sun</hi> is the principle of Corporal Light to the World; ſo Chriſt the <hi>Sun</hi> of Righteouſneſs is the ſource of all Spiritual Light, and whom his Grace and Doctrine do not enlighten, they wander in Darkneſs. <hi>Ego ſum Lux mundi, qui ſequitur me, non ambulat in tenebris.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>My third Prayer paſs'd in continual aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in that I had ſo little known Jeſus Chriſt; and of that extreme blindneſs wherein I had liv'd. At preſent I had almoſt a continual ſight, and a ſweet and forceable inclination to regard this admirable Object; ſo that I thought every moment loſt, which was not ſo imployed. To behold him with amorous affections is a Cure for all my evils. For when my Soul is afflicted with fears of looſing Gods favour, or with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of her Miſeries, or with difficulties about Perfection, one gracious look from Jeſus does eaſily ſcatter theſe clouds, appeaſe this ſtorm, and brings a calm and ſerenity to my Soul.</p>
                     <p>Methinks I ſee clearly, that diffidence in our ſelves, and confidence in Jeſus, (to keep our ſelves at his feet in Prayer, or any other manner near him, as Grace ſhall ſuggeſt,) is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent means to Pray well, and to receive from
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:57606:148"/> the Father of Lights, what is neceſſary to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance us in our way to Perfection.</p>
                     <p>We muſt well obſerve, that what Light and motions we have from Grace, do more unite us to God by proficiency in Virtue; but Natural Lights and Sentiments do not produce the like effect. For example, I may ſee my frailty and weakneſs by knowledge acquired by experience of the Miſeries of this Life. I may know the ſame alſo by the Light of Grace. Grace with knowledge gives me alſo ſtrength and courage to humble my ſelf, to confeſs my frailty, to have recourſe to God for his aſſiſtance. A na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural light has not the like effect, but leaves a man in his pride and miſeries; or what is worſe, in ſadneſs and diſconſolations.</p>
                     <p>Our bleſſed Saviour in my fourth Prayer gave me a ſight and ſentiment of his adorable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon above all expreſſion. The eyes of my Soul being fix'd to behold the Beauty, the Goodneſs, the Grandeurs and Perfections of that admirable <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> my Will could not be ſatisfied with thoſe pleaſures and contentments ſhe then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. O what great happineſs does an enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Soul receive, when the Veil is a little drawn from theſe Divine Myſteries! Methinks I could have ſtood beholding this Divine Object all the days of my life. I conſider'd chiefly, that the holy Soul of Jeſus was enlightened with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, to know what meaſures he ought to take during his mortal life, to fulfil the Decrees of his eternal Father; his wonderful Wiſdom in chooſing an humble, poor, and ſuffering life, to inſtruct us Men, and give Us Example; and
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:57606:149"/> that worldly Wiſdom is but meer Folly, falſe and pernicious to her followers.</p>
                     <p>In this view of Jeſus, every thing in him ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to me charming and admirable; not the leaſt glance from his eye, or word from his mouth, or ſigh or tear from him, but at preſent, was to me an object of infinite delight, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to me ſufficient to take up a Soul for ever with contemplation. But the contemplation of God muſt be accompanied with imitation, and by the conduct of his Grace we muſt enter into his ſtates, poor, abject, and ſuffering; 'tis in vain to think to attain to perfection any other way. The only imitation and conformity to Jeſus, makes the Soul capable of pure contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, and contemplation will preſerve her in this conformity.</p>

                     <p>JEſus, in the <hi>Idaea</hi> of <hi>Ecce homo!</hi> crown'd with Thorns, clad with a Purple Robe in deriſion, buffeted, mock'd, ſpit upon, and ſcourg'd, was the object and ſubject of my morning Prayer. I took great guſt, though full of compaſſion, to ſee him in this poſture, becauſe he himſelf was never more ſatisfied, in that he could never better ſatisfie his Father. And preſently I ſaid, <hi>O my Jeſus! you were never thus array'd before now; all the Glory of Mount</hi> Tabor <hi>did not cloath</hi>
                        <pb n="281" facs="tcp:57606:149"/> 
                        <hi>you with ſuch Beauties; doubtleſs the eternal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther takes infinite complacency to behold you in this ſtate; for you are a Holocauſt, all ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with dolours and deaths, with contempts and annihilations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this entertainment I communicated, and receiv'd my Jeſus in this ſtate, who ſpoke in this manner to my Soul; <hi>I come to thee, to make thee like my ſelf: Thou wilt be never wholly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to me, or my Divine Father, till thou become like me.</hi> I then found in my ſelf a great deſire to be ſo, and that I might take contentedly all diſgraces and loſſes that any accidents brought upon me, as ſo many advantages to make me like to my Saviour. <hi>Ecce homo!</hi> I then remain'd much comforted and fortified, and very devout to Jeſus in this ſtate.</p>
                     <p>In my ſecond Prayer I found my Soul attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a wonderful guſt, to behold Jeſus cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, a ſpectacle pleaſing to the eternal Father, the comfort of Heaven, and the terror of Hell. I diſcover'd a certain way of beauty, which cloathed the horrors of <hi>Calvary</hi> with wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful comlineſs. <hi>O my God!</hi> (ſaid I) <hi>what pleaſure is it to ſee the God of Beauty die for man upon a Croſs!</hi> This beauty is not in his viſage, now all disfigur'd; but in the goodneſs of God, which is here all in ſplendours, and in the tryumphs of an incomparable love, which ſacrificed his moſt precious life for our Redemption. The eternal Father was much delighted with this Beauty.</p>
                     <p>The Bruiſes, and Wounds, and Blood upon his ſacred Head and Face, did not make him disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur'd in my eyes, becauſe the beauty of Divine

And my heart was ſo taken with Jeſus crucified, that I could not but love him in the ſtate of his anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilations.</p>
                     <p>The Grace which this view left in my Soul, was a particular eſteem and love for ſufferings. I ſaw nothing more beautiful, ſeeing they were a kind of Ornament to God himſelf, and rendred him an object of ſingular complacency to his eternal Father. Jeſus hath ſanctified the ſtates of poverty, contempt, and ſufferings, through which he paſſed, to make them ſources of grace to ſuch Souls as love them for his ſake. If the holy places where Chriſt was on Earth are in ſingular veneration, much more ought the ſtates of Jeſus Chriſt. If the men of the world think it a great honour to participate of the grandeurs of their Prince; how happy and Honourable ought a true Chriſtian to think himſelf to be, if he be partaker of the humiliations of the King of Glory? The Crown and Scepter are the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a King: Poverty, Contempts, and Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, are the glory of a Servant of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>In my third Prayer I was pierced with a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful feeling at the ſight of Jeſus ſuffering and dying on the Croſs. Being not able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend how the infinite Majeſty of a God ſhould condeſcend ſo low, I ſaid, <hi>O my Jeſus! why did you not rather let all men periſh? for 'tis more juſt beyond compariſon, that men ſhould be loſt, being</hi>
                        <pb n="283" facs="tcp:57606:152"/> 
                        <hi>Guilty, than you ſuffer, being most Innocent. But in this tryumph of your love, you have no regard to your ſelf, but to ſatisfie Divine Justice, and that Infinite Charity you have for your poor Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in their miſerable condition. Suffer then even the death of the Croſs, ſeeing, dear Jeſus, it is your pleaſure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I conſider'd the eternal obligations we have to Jeſus Chriſt, in that he died for our Salvation. It ſeem'd to me that hitherto I had been as in darkneſs, in regard to this incomparable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit Jeſus Chriſt is our true and faithful Friend indeed; and yet, alas! he is neither known nor regarded as he ought, nor lov'd with thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. He loves us ſo as to die for us, and we make no reciprocal returns. O the prodigious inſenſibility of men! Is then Jeſus Chriſt a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to us, and not our God and Saviour? Does the Hiſtory of his holy Paſſion paſs with us, as a profane or indifferent thing? Ought not the bloody Tragedy of <hi>Calvary</hi> fill all Chriſtian hearts with love and ſorrow? For my part, I could hide my head with ſhame, that I have ſo little compaſſion and love for Jeſus dying on the Croſs for our Salvation.</p>
                     <p>O my Jeſus! I confeſs my fault, in that I have ſo little known my infinite obligations to you. But ſeeing your Grace diſcovers now to me more clear than heretofore what you are, I will never more loſe ſight of you; I will love nothing more than You, and eſteem nothing more than to do you honour. You are my true Father, my true Brother, true Friend, true King, true Redeemer. O how great a truth is it, that you are all in all
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:57606:153"/> unto me! O that I have been ſo long without knowing you aright! O Jeſus, how Happy am I that I have found you! O let me never ſo much looſe my ſelf, as to forſake you!</p>
                     <p>For my fourth Prayer, I ſtood at the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of Jeſus, and ſeeing his precious Body dead and covered with Wounds, I made this Epitaph; <hi>Here lyes Love.</hi> Yes, yes, here lyes Love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, for his exceſſive Love to us, brought him to this ſtate and condition. A ſtate full of horror and wounds, Blood and Infamy; But a ſtate well pleaſing to God, as ſatisfying his Juſtice for mans Redemption. I embraced his precious Body, and kiſs'd his Sacred Wounds; I adored Jeſus in this ſtate, and ſaid; <hi>O my Soul, we muſt either ceaſe to Love Jeſus, or die with him, ſeeing Love equalizes Lovers, and makes them alike.</hi> My Soul then choſe to die with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and after many ſighs and deſires to pleaſe her Beloved, ſhe died with Jeſus, never willing more to live a Natural and Humane Life, but a Life Divine and Supernatural, as that of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. And I made for her this Epitaph. <hi>Here lyes a Soul dead of Love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Behold in what conſiſts the death of my Soul; 'tis to live no longer according to the natural Inclinations, but according to the motions of Grace; which are the Love of Poverty, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and Sufferings. While theſe diſpoſitions live in a Soul, ſhe is dead to Senſual deſires, and lives a Life of Grace, a Life Supernatural. Therefore for the future I will never hunt after Honours, or Pleaſures, or Riches willingly, and by Election; but I will either heartily forſake
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:57606:153"/> them; or if I uſe them, it ſhall be upon Divine Motives, for the good of my Neighbour, or for pure neceſſity; ſeeing That is the Will of God, the ſureſt rule of all our Actions.</p>

                     <head>Tenth Day. <hi>Jeſus riſen from Death, and Glorious.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IN my Morning Prayer I conſider'd the Glory of Jeſus Chriſt in the ſtate of his trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Reſurrection. O Jeſus how Glorious are you! How well does this become you? Verily 'twas a ſtrange ſtate whither your Love had brought you: A ſtate of Miſery, Shame, and Sorrow. This was well for us Criminals, but in no ſort agreeing to you, who are Innocence it ſelf: For what belongs to you, is Majeſty and Glory, What joy did ſwell my heart to ſee Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Glorious? My Tongue cannot expreſs what my Heart feels. This great Feaſt of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is to be celebrated by all Creatures, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'tis the day wherein Jeſus appears as God. O Feaſt of the Glory of <hi>Jeſus!</hi> O Feaſt of the Glory of <hi>Mary!</hi> 'Twas a Miracle ſhe did not die of Sorrow at the Death of her Son; and 'tis another Miracle ſhe did not die of Joy at his Glorious Reſurrection.</p>
                     <p>O my heart, be thou enlarged with Joy, for 'tis a general rule without exception, that the Intereſt of the Creator is to be preferr'd before all Creatures. And therefore O triumphant Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:57606:154"/> I more rejoyce that you are Glorious, then that I hope to be Glorified with you. Yea, though I ſhould never be raiſed, your Glory does raviſh me. It glads me when I conſider, that damnation only concerns the Creature; for the Intereſt of Jeſus ſuffers not thereby; ſeeing God is Glorified by the Reprobates, as well as by the Saints in Glory.</p>
                     <p>'Tis alſo a certain rule, that the Elect, O Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Jeſus, are Images of you, and ſo neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly muſt reſemble you in your Sufferings, if with you they will be Glorified. 'Tis a folly to think not to ſuffer here ſome way or other, more or leſs, ſeeing the way to Glory is by Sufferings. O my Soul, be thou united to Jeſus Crucified, and then thou ſhalt have part with Jeſus Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. To this end thou muſt love the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and deſire of Jeſus to die, or ſuffer. O World, thy way is meer folly, and nothing elſe.</p>
                     <p>In my ſecond Prayer I was taken up with theſe words of Divine Jeſus: <hi>Ought not Chriſt firſt to ſuffer, and ſo to enter into Glory?</hi> I diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd how all the Divine Perfections did won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully ſhine forth therein: But above all the Wiſdom of God doth raviſh thoſe hearts which contemplate the works of Grace and Mercy. O Divine Wiſdom how well is the Oeconomy of your Myſteries order'd, to work our Salvation, and bring us to Glory? Every Myſtery which I conſider'd, did raiſe a new Fire in my breaſt, to inflame my affections with the Love of Jeſus. Sometimes they altogether did, (as with ſo many arrows,) pierce my heart, and made me languiſh with Divine Love, For ſeeing my ſelf
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57606:154"/> ſo Belov'd of good Jeſus, how could I but Love him again?</p>
                     <p>O Infinite Love of Jeſus, for whom ſhall I have a heart, if not for thee? O Love, 'tis for thee my heart is reſerved. Thy attracts are powerful enough, do not redouble them ſo ſweet and charming; 'tis enough, my heart is for thee. O Love, except thou wilt have me die, do not wound me any more. Yet I will die willingly, if thou wilt have it ſo, on the <hi>Croſs</hi> of Interiour and Exteriour Suffering, that I may be conform to my Loving Saviour.</p>
                     <p>My third Prayer was a continuation of the Sentiments of the Love of Jeſus. I made uſe of the words of great St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: <hi>O my Jeſus, you have wounded my heart with the arrows of your Charity, and I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted it to your Love. Since that you have ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd my Darkneſs, and made your ſelf known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, I have not forgot you. Since I had the Happineſs to know you, I have imprinted you in my memory; there I find you, and I taſt perfect Delights; and receive extreme Joy and Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when I remember you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>My Soul feeling Divine Fires within her, which did fill her with Pleaſures, I did ſing <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore</hi> Canticles to my Beloved, and though not methodical, yet they better expreſs'd her amorous languiſhings. Though alone in my Chamber, I ſpake of Jeſus aloud, as if I had had many Auditors to be partakers of my Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
                     <p>I make <hi>Colloquies</hi> among many Lovers of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. I think I hear St. <hi>Romuald</hi> ſay; <hi>My dear</hi>
                        <pb n="288" facs="tcp:57606:155"/> 
                        <hi>Jeſus, my ſweet Love, the ineſtimable Object of my Deſires, the Delight of Saints, the Joy of Angels, who will give me to Love you as much by my Self, as they do altogether?</hi> Another anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>Seeing your Perfections, O good Jeſus, have no limits, the Love which all hearts have for you, ought to be Infinite.</hi> Another ſaid; <hi>O Saviour, the Fruits are Teſtimonies of true Love; your appear to me admirable in the effects of your Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and that bloody Death you endured for me. But what have I done as yet to teſtify my Love, or make you Love me?</hi> Another concluded, and ſaid; <hi>Let us Love, and Suffer, and let us die by the hands of the ſame Love, which made Jeſus die upon the Croſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O Sacred Love, how kindly cruel art thou to thoſe who fall into thy hands? For thou doſt cut and mortifie, and humble, and annihilate. All thy Servants more or leſs carry the marks of thy Severity. St. <hi>Philip Nereus</hi> in his Ribbs; St. <hi>Francis</hi> in his Hands, and Feet, and very Heart. But O Divine Love, I fear not thy Cruelty; Mortifie me, Crucifie me, Burn me Alive; I deſire to die by no other hand.</p>
                     <p>The concluſion of all the Prayers of my So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, was an abſolute abandon of my ſelf to Jeſus Chriſt; to whom I gave my ſelf up in a new manner irrevocably, to live or die, to act or ſuffer, to be in ſuch a ſtate as beſt pleaſes him: Ardently deſiring that his Sacred Love would make me die to all things but himſelf. The Martyrdom of Love is longer then that of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and ſometimes more tormenting; fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt all our natural Inclinations, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:57606:155"/> through all oppoſitions whatſoever, to practice the virtues of the <hi>Word Incarnate.</hi> Without doubt we ſuffer much, to follow that Grace which calls us to die on a <hi>Croſs,</hi> poor, contemned, and abandoned. But he that Loves, finds ſweetneſs in theſe Sufferings.</p>
                     <p>'Tis a great wonder to make a Creature of nothing: But 'tis a far greater to make a ſinner a Saint: And this, O Jeſus, is the only work of your Grace. 'Tis you that are victorious and triumphant in all your Elect over the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and malignity of Sin.</p>
                     <p>O Jeſus, how great is the Power of your Grace? How is your right Hand glorified by working wonders? O Jeſus, the Infinite ſource of Power and Virtue, of Grace and Sanctity, of Beauty and Perfection, O that I have as yet ſo little known you! In Heaven they only ſee you clearly, but yet 'tis a Favour and Happineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond expreſſion to have ſome knowledge of you in this Life. When I behold Jeſus, my Soul wants words, and can ſay nothing but <hi>Jeſus;</hi> and in ſaying <hi>Jeſus,</hi> it ſays all it would, though it be ineffable.</p>
                     <p>O Jeſus, vouchſafe me ſome little ſight of you in this baniſhment, that my Soul may be comforted. Jeſus, God and Man, the eternal Splendour and Crown of Saints, be you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after the only Object of my Deſires and Love, that I may be ſo united to you, as never to ſuffer a ſeparation.</p>
                     <p>When Jeſus once poſſeſſes a Soul, her Thoughts are on him, her Words are to him, and her Love is for him. She then lives in a region of Light,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:57606:156"/> Beautiful beyond all expreſſion; and in her ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of Love, ſhe ſeems wholly Paſſive to the operations of Jeſus in her. Jeſus is enlightning, enflaming, Piercing, and Conſummating; Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is more in the Soul then her ſelf, and lives more in her then her ſelf; all is converted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Jeſus, by a co-operation of Love which ſhe feels, but cannot explicate.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems to my Soul, that hitherto ſhe has been but in continual amuſements. How many vain <hi>Idaeas</hi> have taken up her Thoughts? But at the ſight of Jeſus, all Creatures appear'd but as Dreams, and they fled before him, as Owls at Sun-riſing. I know you then, O amiable Jeſus, I ſee that you are Verity, and all the World but Vanity.</p>
                     <p>O Divine Jeſus, reign for ever in my Soul, eſtabliſh your Empire in my heart, and be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute King there, for it is yours. Let all the Bleſſed Angels and Saints in Heaven, and all Creatures Bleſs you and Praiſe you, and help me to return you Thanks for all the Favours your Infinite Goodneſs has vouchſaſed me in this Retreat. Add this alſo, O moſt Merciful Jeſus, to your other Graces, that I may have a perpetual dependance on your Holy Will, and live in you, and for you, who lives and reigns World without end, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>A Perſon that often receives his God in the Holy Communion, ought to direct all the Actions of his Life to that end, and render them a Preparation to it. And as thoſe Acts whereby we prepare our ſelves, ought to be moſt Holy, moſt repleniſhed with Grace; ſo by conſequence the Life of one that does of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten frequent the Sacrament, ought to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued exerciſe of Holy and Supernatural Acts. We ought to lead a Life worthy of the <hi>Divine Bread</hi> which is given us in this adorable Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A common and material Bread ſupports the Life of Nature: But he who is himſelf the <hi>Bread of Graces,</hi> beſtows on us a Life of Grace, a Life Holy and Divine, and Infinitely rais'd
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:57606:157"/> above the Humane Life: And therefore is little known, little ſought by ſuch as lead a common Life, and are unwilling to leave themſelves and their Temporal concerns, to live to Jeſus Chriſt, who to that end gives himſelf to them, that he may be their Life.</p>
                  <p>O my God, how Ignorant and Earthly has my paſt Life been, ſince I am ſo little acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this Life more than Humane! But now out of your Mercy you vouchſafe to beſtow on me ſuch Sentiments as incline me to enter upon this Life: For I plainly ſee that a Soul well ſettled in the ſtate of Grace, ought to live no longer according to Nature, but according to Grace. The Motions, Maxims and Deſigns of the Supernatural Life take their Original from Grace, and are of a very different reliſh from ſuch as affect Souls, which move only by the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Nature. For the Soul actuated by this Life, embraces Contempts, Sufferings, Abjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and her delight is to be annihilated in the eſteem and love of Creatures; ſo far it is from ſeeking thoſe things, never ſo little. To live this Life, is to live the Life of Jeſus, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one and the ſame with him; and it is an excellent Diſpoſition to live by him, while the Soul receives him as its proper nouriſhment: <hi>Qui manducat me, vivet propter me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your Delights, O Lord, are to be with the Children of Men: But theſe Delights ought to be Reciprocal; that is to ſay, That Souls ought to take their Delights in you, in your ſtate of Poverty and Abjection, that ſo you may take your Delights in them. What an exceſs of
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:57606:157"/> Goodneſs is this, O Lord, that being ſo great, ſo full of Glory, you come to humble your ſelf, and to annihilate your ſelf in a Soul ſo Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, ſo Unfaithful! 'Tis true, Abjections were not inconſiſtent with the condition of your Mortal Life: But ſince now you are in Glory, methinks you ought to be exempt from them. If my Soul had any Love for your Intereſts, ſhe would not procure you ſuch Humiliations: and therefore ſhe would do better not to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate ſo often; for then ſhe would not be the occaſion of humbling you ſo often. This Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, joyned with the knowledge of my own unworthineſs, would make me abſtain from Communicating, if I did not know withall that your Delights are to be with ſuch Souls as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire likewiſe to take their Delights in you, and that you have ſaid in St. <hi>John, That if we do not eat your Adorable Fleſh, we ſhall not have Life in you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When I conſider my Indignity, and yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent my ſelf to Communicate, with a Soul that is an ever-flowing ſource of Vices and Sins; I ſhould be very much afflicted to ſee Jeſus Chriſt ſo ill lodged in the midſt of my Imperfections, not knowing in what part of my Soul I might place him. Where he might not ſee things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of his Preſence. This ſight would doubtleſs cauſe me a great deal of pain, if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regard did not encourage me. I conſider that, when the <hi>Sun</hi> enters into a ſtinking and and offenſive Dungeon, he is received there more in his own Brightneſs and Luſtre than in the Dungeon it ſelf; and that ſo he is there without
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:57606:158"/> prejudicing his Grandeur or Purity. When I have this <hi>Idaea</hi> before my eyes, I ſay to my Lord: 'Tis true you enter into me all miſerable as I am: But it is true alſo, that you are more in your Self, in your Glory and in your Brightneſs. Be therefore received in your Self, O Divine Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, in your Beauty and in your Grandeurs. I rejoyce that the offenſiveneſs and ſtreightneſs of my Dungeon cannot prejudice your Beauties, or your Greatneſs. Enter therefore into me, without going out of your Self: Be received in me, but more in your Self, O bright <hi>Sun</hi> of Glory! Live for ever in the midſt of your own Splendours and Magnificence; but do not ceaſe to live alſo in the middle of my Obſcurities and Miſery. Convert me unto you wholly, and without reſerve.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>JEſus Chriſt choſe to give himſelf to us in this ſtupendious Myſtery, in the ſtate of Death, as to any thing that concerns the life of the Senſes; but as a Fountain of Life in regard of the Interiour Life; a Divine Life, a Life of Grace, a Life of Contemplation and of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual application of the mind to adore the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God his Father: A Life, I ſay, poor, and nothing to the Exteriour, but ſhining with
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:57606:158"/> the Divineſt and moſt awful Luſtre, and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely rich under the vails of the outward <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> that hid it from the eyes of the World. Thus and with theſe diſpoſitions he preſents himſelf to us, requiring that we likewiſe preſent our ſelves unto him with diſpoſitions conformable to his.</p>
                  <p>His Sacred Humanity, that he gives us in the Holy Communion, was rais'd to a Divine Life by the Hypoſtatical Union: So alſo muſt we be by Grace, <hi>viz.</hi> Our underſtanding muſt be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated above it ſelf by a high illuſtration of Faith, and our Will inflamed by a ſublime Senſe of the Love of God; and ſo in fine, our whole Soul muſt be animated with the Life of Grace. O the Sublimity of the Life of Grace! How Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable art thou, how High, how Ineffable! Thou raiſeſt man from Earth to Heaven, thou makeſt him live in God, I, and of God too, ſince thou doſt prepare him to live in this World upon the ſame Subſtance which nouriſheth the Bleſſed in Heaven. O great Life of Grace! thou art poor to the Exteriour, but moſt rich to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour: Thou appeareſt low, but art moſt high. I am raviſhed with thy Beauties, I cannot live a moment without Thee, who makeſt us live with a Life Divine, who placeſt the Soul in the heart of God, and diſpoſeſt her to ſee God placed in her own Heart.</p>
                  <p>When the Charms and Beauty of this Life have once diſcovered themſelves to the Soul, ſhe willingly quits all other things, to imbrace them, and whatſoever elſe ſeems to her no better than Death and Corruption; ſhe renounces the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:57606:159"/> World, Pleaſures and Riches; ſhe condemns her ſelf to Pennances, Mortifications and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, to obtain this Divine Life; and feels a Sacred hunger after this adorable nouriſhment that is her only ſupport. O that I did through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know, that I did Faithfully purſue this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Life, a Life ſo little known, ſo little practis'd in the World, where People do not thirſt after the Living Waters of your Eternal Fountain. O my God! O Jeſus, draw me after you through all the Actions and Duties of the Life of Grace, which is at its greateſt height among Injuries and Miſeries. Draw me, O Lord, and I will run after you in the Odour of your Perfumes. What a pleaſure is it, O my Soul, to ſee you march like a Gyant in the ways of Grace, nouriſhed and ſtrengthened in your courſe with the Bread of Heaven: <hi>Ambulavit in fortitudine cibi illius uſ<expan>

                  </p>
                  <p>To live in Death, (as Jeſus ſeems to do in the Bleſſed Sacrament) to change Glory for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, to be moſt delighted when one is anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated and even Sacrificed, is the true Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Life of Grace. It makes all things die to the Exteriour, and live only to the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, and above all things it confers the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Prayer, keeping the Soul almoſt in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual exerciſe and elevation, by fixing its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard upon that Infinite and incomprehenſible Being which ſhe adores and is not able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and therefore annihilates her ſelf in his preſence, ſuſpended with admiration of thoſe Divine Grandeurs which ſhe ſees annihilated in the <hi>Holy Euchariſt.</hi> O my Soul. how great is
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:57606:159"/> thy Vileneſs, how extream is thy Poverty! <hi>What is man, that thou, O Lord, art mindful of him;</hi> Doſt viſit him and takeſt pleaſure to come and dwell perſonally in him? His Soul is drawn out of nothing, his Body is but a piece of Clay, and ſtill you vouchſafe to ſet your eyes upon him! How can a Creature ſo filthy, ſo wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo groſs, receive within it the Infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God. Sink and humble your ſelf to the very center of your Nothing, and confeſs your Indignities, O my Soul. Caſt down your eyes, and acknowledge that you are unworthy ſo much as to lift them up towards this formidable Grandeur; and more than all be penetrated with the deep ſenſe of Admiration, Gratitude and love of this exceſſive Goodneſs, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcends in this incomprehenſible Myſtery to annihilate it ſelf, to come and give it ſelf to you even in the ſtate of your own Nothing.</p>
                  <p>We muſt needs be very much in Love with our condition of Interiour Captivity, where the Soul lyes bound and ty'd up in darkneſs and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. For this condition Honoureth the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Jeſus confined to the narrow compaſs of a little <hi>Hoſt.</hi> This Divine Lord of ours ſhuts himſelf up in this ſtrait Priſon for the Love of us. The King of Glory is contracted under theſe little <hi>Species,</hi> and ſo renders himſelf a Priſoner to man; yes, he renders himſelf in appearance his Slave; giving all of himſelf to man, and ſtill Sacrificing himſelf to his Eternal Father for man: He ſtill ſuffers (as I may ſay) and dies for man, and communicates to him all the merits of his precious Blood and Paſſion. O Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:57606:160"/> Captive, captivate my heart ſo ſtrongly that it may never be able to re-enter into its natural liberty: But that wholly deſtroyed and annihilated, it may never be capable of any other Life than that which is more than Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane: Never enjoy any other liberty than that of your Children. Let the World look upon them as ſlaves: And load them with all Indignities as the out-caſt of men; in deſpite of all contempt they are ſtill your Children.</p>
                  <p>Every time we approach to this Sacrament wherein Jeſus Chriſt gives himſelf to us whole and entire, we enter into a new obligation and contract to give up our ſelves wholly &amp; entirely to him, and to endeavour to render all our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Divine. Wherefore a Virtuous Soul ought not to ſay; I have not had time enough to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare my ſelf before Communion; for ſhe ought to aim at no other thing in all the Actions of her Life, than to receive this Bread of Life, to the end ſhe may live the Life of Jeſus, and keep her ſelf continually in ſuch diſpoſitions as ſhe ſees him in, in the Bleſſed Sacrament.</p>

                  <p>I remark Principally three Actions that Jeſus Chriſt was pleas'd to do for our example when he inſtituted the Holy Sacrament: And we cannot make a perfect Communion without the practice of them. 1. He never performed
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:57606:160"/> any Exteriour Act of ſuch a profound Humility. In Truth he annihilated himſelf in the work of his Incarnation: Both according to his Humane Nature which he deprived of its Natural Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in an extraordinary way of conception: And according to his Divinity which he plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the Abiſs of Humane Miſeries. Yet he debaſed himſelf farther when he choſe a Stable to be born in, as the moſt Poor and Abject of Men: Still more when he condeſcended to take the Badge of Sinners in his Circumciſion; But the loweſt Abiſs and center of annihilation was in the Chamber where he made the laſt Supper, and where he did a thing that is the moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of all Humane Actions, waſhing the Feet drying them, kiſſing them with his adorable Lips, and this even to the greateſt of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and moſt wicked Miſcreant that ever lived, even to <hi>Judas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O my Jeſus, this is too much debaſing of your Grandeurs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'tis too profound a Humiliation of your Majeſty. 'Tis my duty, who am a meer Nothing by the condition of my Being, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come leſs than nothing by the enormity of my ſins; 'tis my duty to annihilate my ſelf under the feet of the vileſt of Creatures. What an intolerable Pride would it be in me, if, having ſeen the God of Majeſty humbling himſelf ſo profoundly to give example, and having heard him tell me ſo with his own mouth: <hi>Exemplum dedi vobis, ut &amp; vos it a faciatis; I have given you an example, that you ſhould do ſo as you have ſeen me do:</hi> What a Pride (I ſay) would it be in me to approach to your Communion without the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:57606:161"/> of the greateſt Humility that I can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly exhibit in any Action of my Life?</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Action our Divine Maſter practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced when he inſtituted this great Sacrament, was a ſublime Prayer, one of the moſt perfect, as well as one of the laſt that he made in all his Life; lifting up his Hands, Eyes and Heart to God his Father, by an Act of a moſt reſpectful Reverence. And though he was himſelf his own Heaven where his Father reigned, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collects himſelf into this moſt Sacred Humanity, as into a new Heaven, and there addreſſes his Prayers to his Father who was preſent to him, and his firſt Petition is, <hi>Glorifie me, O Father;</hi> which is to ſay, give me the joy of Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Opprobries of the <hi>Croſs</hi> which I have ſo long deſired and ſighed after: Teaching his Church to look upon Contempts and Croſſes as her Glory, and the greateſt Honour ſhe can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire upon Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He demands alſo the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this ineffable Myſtery of the <hi>Holy Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt,</hi> which he was going to make in obedience to his Eternal Will and Decree; knowing that it was to be unto us a Fountain of Eternal Life, and unto himſelf the beginning of a perpetual Death, as continuing there in quality of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice even to the conſummation of the World.</p>
                  <p>It is my Duty therefore, after his Example, to prepare my Soul to receive his Divine My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries by the moſt pure and moſt perfect Prayer, as God ſhall enlighten and inſpire me. The moſt aſſured is, to apply ones ſelf to him by a ſimple regard of Faith, accompanied with Reſpect and Love, conſidering him full of Graces, full
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:57606:161"/> of Mercies and Bleſſings in this awful Myſtery, and that he comes unto us with all his riches, and gives himſelf without any reſerve, even rendring himſelf in a manner paſſive for all the deſigns that he intends to accompliſh within us, whether he comes himſelf in perſon to operate there the marvellous effects of his Love. This ſole regard of Faith in its ſimplicity contains all the Perfections of other Acts. 'Tis ſufficient to have God by Regard unto him and by Love; this is to attain to the end where the heart reſts: All other Exerciſes of Meditation and Practices of Interiour Virtues are but only means to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive unto God; when he is once found, the Soul is to repoſe there and reſt ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>The third and moſt endearing Action that I admire in our Lord when he Inſtituted the Bleſſed Sacrament, and when he made his Love appear in its greateſt Luſtre, and in its moſt Ardent Fervour, as well towards God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as towards Men, even his Enemies. When he comes into the World, his Love is a riſing <hi>Sun:</hi> But when he comes to leave the World, in the vigour of his Life, and in the exceſs of Charity that he ſhew'd in dying for us, he is a <hi>Sun</hi> in the heat of Noon day. The <hi>Goſpel</hi> tells us, <hi>That having loved his own that were in the World, he kindled the flames of his Charity, and raiſed them to the higheſt point imaginable, when he Inſtituted the Holy and adorable Sacrament; In finem dilexit eos.</hi> But that which is moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable in it, which the moſt of any thing demonſtrates the eminence of his Charity, is that he did not refuſe the moſt charming and
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:57606:162"/> moſt tender embraces to the moſt unworthy and moſt perfidious of all his Enemies. <hi>Judas,</hi> whom Envy had already poiſoned even to the heart, whom Avarice had perverted and made a Thief; Inſenſibleneſs had blinded and made ungrateful; whom Malice had corrupted and made an Apoſtate, a Traytor, a very Devil; yet this <hi>Judas</hi> in this condition that he was, and in which Jeſus ſaw him at the bottom of his heart, is not excluded from the eminent Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deurs of the Love of our Saviour, which feeds this <hi>Demon</hi> with the <hi>Manna</hi> of Angels. O Love, how thou art admirable! O Love, how thou art invincible! an abundance of waters cannot extinguiſh thy flames.</p>
                  <p>And now, my Soul, is it poſſible thou ſhouldſt continue tepid and inſenſible while thou art near ſo great a Fire? Hadſt thou all the Ardours of the <hi>Seraphins,</hi> thou wouldſt ſtill be too little on Fire to anſwer and reflect the Fires of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Love which inflames his heart when he comes to give himſelf to thee: A good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious <hi>Capuchin,</hi> called <hi>Br. Bonaventure,</hi> felt his Soul ſo inflamed with this Sacred Fire when he approached to the Holy Table, that one day, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, finding himſelf more than ordinary repleniſhed with an Ardent deſire to unite him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with God; and ſeeing the moſt Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in the <hi>Prieſts</hi> hand ready to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate him, his heart ſeem'd to make ſtrong efforts to leap out of his Breaſt and meet the only Object of its deſires, which alſo broke forth into words: For the abundance of his Love forced out their amorous Aſpirations:
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:57606:162"/> 
                     <hi>My Jeſu! My Jeſu! My Jeſu!</hi> But to let both him and us know that the Love of Jeſus in this unſpeakable Myſtery ſurpaſſes all ours in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite meaſure, the <hi>Holy Hoſt</hi> quitted the <hi>Prieſt's</hi> hand, and as it were all on a flame and encircled with Glorious Rayes of Light, of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, flew into the Mouth of this worthy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God.</p>

                  <p>SOme times when I was Communicating, it came into my mind to think that my heart was an <hi>Altar,</hi> and that Jeſus Chriſt came to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue upon it the ſame operations that he had performed on that <hi>Altar</hi> where the <hi>Holy Maſs</hi> is Celebrated. Wherefore my heart received him lovingly and ſimply, united it ſelf to all his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Operations relating both to his Heavenly Father, and to Creatures: And my Soul adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to all his Adorations, all his Sacrifices, all his Love that he bears his Eternal Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came wholly paſſive, like an <hi>Altar</hi> upon which Jeſus does all that he pleaſes, as well in regard of the Divinity, as in regard of Men to whom he diſtributes and diſpenſes his Mercies.</p>
                  <p>It ſeemed to me that in the firſt place he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd himſelf to honour his Divine Father, to annihilate himſelf before his greatneſs, to love his Goodneſs and other Divine Perfections, and
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:57606:163"/> then he turned himſelf to ſuccour my weakneſs, and ſhew his Mercies upon me, by giving me a glimpſe of what he is, and a fight of the ſtrick and cloſe alliance whereby I ought to be united to him; that I ought not to ſubſiſt a moment but by his Life; that his Holy Spirit ought to animate my Soul, and be the firſt ſpring of all its motion, as my Soul moves my Body, and is the Principal of all its operations: That to live a Life purely Humane, is a ſtate wherein though a Soul does not offend God, yet ſhe cannot pleaſe him; which is a thing Love cannot ſuffer, nor will it endure that a Soul wherein it reigns ſhould ceaſe any one moment from pleaſing her Beloved.</p>
                  <p>O Jeſus, enter into ſo abſolute a poſſeſſion of my Soul that ſhe may be wholly yours, and that ſhe may never have any other motion than what your Grace gives her. 'Tis the great deſire of my Soul, which would not live to you partly, and partly to Creatures; but that all the actions of my Life be Conſecrated to your Love. I have need of a Powerful Grace, O Jeſu, to continue thus elevated above my ſelf in all ſort of occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: But vouchſafe to magnifie your Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence in my weakneſs, your Mercies in my Miſeries.</p>
                  <p>Another time after Communion, I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to me the manner how all the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Faculties of Jeſus Chriſt in his Mortal Life did moſt worthily Glorifie his Eternal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: All the parts of his Holy Soul were taken up in this imployment; the Intellectual Powers of the Superiour part the Beatifical Viſion and
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:57606:163"/> Fruition; the Inferiour part and his Body by a moſt perfect Suffering. I ſaw the admirable connexion which was between theſe ſo different ſtates, and their joynt accord to Glorifie the Eternal Father: And the wonderful Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of this Sacred Interiour charmed my Soul: I continually offered it up to God in the preſſures I lay under; in the midſt of my troubles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into theſe Holy Diſpoſitions, and united my Sufferigs with his, my Actions with his Divine ones. This diſpoſition remains deeply imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in me, and ſerves me for a comfort and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port upon all occaſion of our contempt, pains or any other affliction.</p>
                  <p>Another time my Interiour entertainment during Communion was after this manner. I conſider'd that a Chriſtian has but two concerns in this Life, how to maintain the Life of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that of Grace, thereby to arrive to that of Glory. Generally men think of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the firſt, though it be of no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and but for a moment, beſides that is full of Miſeries; and they forget the ſecond, which is Eternal, and Infinite importance; yet ſcarce any body minds it, for every one lives in the darkneſs of Imperfection, and the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Senſe. O what a Miſery! And on the contrary, how Happy are they who ſet no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue but upon the Life of Grace, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love thoſe Exerciſe which nouriſh and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it, as Mortifications, Prayer, frequent Communion! O how clearly do I ſee that I ought to diſingage my ſelf from Temporal Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, to apply my ſelf more fully to the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:57606:164"/> of the Life of Grace, and to pure Prayer!</p>
                  <p>I made another time my Action of Grace after this manner. An attention to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God before Communion had raiſed in me a great and awful reſpect towards that moſt Sacred Majeſty, before whom the higheſt <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins</hi> in Heaven do tremble. The like impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion continued in me alſo after Communion: My Soul was all adoration ſeeing the adorable Jeſus was become her Gueſt: His Preſence heightned my reſpect, as being the ſource of all Graces, and of all good Diſpoſitions. I ſaw himſelf alſo ſometimes paying a profound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to God the Father; and then I plunged my ſelf deeper, and even loſt my ſelf in thoſe Divine Reſpects, unwilling to come out of them: And fearing leaſt ſome perſons ſhould come to viſit me, and interrupt my Devotion, I hid my ſelf, that I might remain thus wholly plunged in this Sentiment of Reverence which Perfumed my Soul.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Jeſus entring into my Mouth, vailed with the Sacramental Species, I Sacrifice to him all my Being, my Faculties and Operations in Homage to
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:57606:164"/> his Grandeur. And after this Act I remain quite annihilated and paſſive to Jeſus, operating towards his Heavenly Father, Love, Reſpect, and Praiſe; towards my Self, Death, Annihilation, and Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with his Divine Life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſecond Diſpoſition after the <hi>Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> is, that Jeſus entring into me, preſently operates a ſtreight <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion. At that time I have no ſight of any that may annihilate me; only at firſt he unites me to the ſtate of his Humanity in its Poverty and Abjections; the Contempt, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Sufferings of his Mortal Life; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereby purified, next he draws me to a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with the ſtate of his Divinity, that is to ſay, to render to his Eternal Father, Love, Praiſes and complacency in his Grandeurs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another time after <hi>Holy Communion,</hi> theſe great words of our Lord preſented themſelves to my mind to ſerve for my Entertainment; <hi>Rogo Pater, ut ſint conſummati in unum: Father I beſeech you, that they may be conſummated in one.</hi> They diſcloſe to me a little of that perfect <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, or conſummated <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion that ought to be contracted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Jeſus and us: His Love requiring that our Souls ſhould be confirmed in that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe of the <hi>Holy Communion,</hi> and that they act continually according to the conditions of this Alliance; from whence they fall by the leaſt Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and very much offend God, who ſees himſelf neglected, and as it were contemned and poſt-poned to Creatures, after he has called them to ſo perfect a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, and come expreſly to work it in them.
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:57606:165"/> Wherefore a perfect <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion requires that our heart be united the moſt continually that poſſibly it can, and that it tend inceſſantly to a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Love with Jeſus Chriſt, to a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Inſtinct, of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, of Deſires, and to a great conformity with the condition of his Mortal Life, which is that whereby we are to walk during our preſent Life, if we deſire to arrive to the enjoyment of his Divine Life.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Sometimes after Communicating, I have had this repreſentation in my mind, that Jeſus giving himſelf to me, ſeemed to ſpeak to me, but without any kind of words: For the ſole manifeſtation of his Love imparted to the Soul, is in lieu of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the Soul anſwers by Acquieſcence and Admiration that cannot be expreſsed. In effect, the Soul in this ſtate does not underſtand any Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour words, after the manner that Myſtique Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines explain them in their Writings: But the lively and clear repreſentation that is made to her of the ſtate of Jeſus in each Myſtery, without any thing elſe, ſerves her for Diſcourſe. While ſhe is in this condition, it ſeems to her that Jeſus ſays, <hi>Hear Daughter, and ſee, and forget your People, and the Houſe of your Father, to enter into an imitation of me.</hi> To which words the Soul makes anſwer by acquieſſing, and without any noiſe in her Interiour, ſhe ſignifies her acceptance by a moſt efficatious conſent. She hears by ſeeing, and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſpeaks by manifeſting himſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another while at the</hi> Communion <hi>I had a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral view of the multitude of the great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
                     <pb n="309" facs="tcp:57606:165"/> 
                     <hi>that Jeſus operates in theſe Myſteries of Faith, in favour of Men, with whom he takes his Delight. This general view raiſed me to a high admiration, which nevertheleſs termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a ſenſe of a moſt profound acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Goodneſs of God, ſeeing that all theſe wonders tend to no other end than to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt unto us the intenſeneſs of the Love he bears us, and import that he expects Love for Love. That is your only deſign, my good Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu, in beſtowing on me this Divine Food, to beſtow on me the Life of your Love; but this Life may very well cauſe my Death. O Love, Love, Love! was all that I could then ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtruck dumb with admiration.</hi>

                  <p>I Find a great guſt in the underſtanding of theſe words; <hi>Fortis eſt ut mors dilectio: Love is ſtrong as Death.</hi> Methinks I ſee them practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally verified in the <hi>Holy Communion,</hi> where I ſee that Love has reduced Jeſus to the ſtate of Death and of a Sacrifice immolated, as Death reduced him upon Mount <hi>Calvary.</hi> I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that while his Love ſevers him from the Splendours of his Glory to unite himſelf to me, it excites me at the ſame time to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate my ſelf, from Creatures, from my Self, and from all other things, thereby to unite my ſelf to him alone. My Soul thoroughly pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:57606:166"/> with a deſire to correſpond with this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of her Beloved Jeſus, and clearly diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that the love of Croſſes and Contempt is neceſſary to diſpoſe and prepare her for this great Favour, ſhe looks on them with affection and delight, as ſo many Springs whence flows her Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Another wonder, which ſometimes my mind has been intent upon, and received great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from it, is the Infinite deſire that God has to Communicate himſelf, and to lift us up to a full participation of his Divinity. This view well penetrated into, diſcovers ſo many wonders of the Love of God towards Men, of the Felicities to which they are deſtined after the Miſeries of this World, of the Dignity of their Creation (ſince the end for which they were made is to poſſeſs God,) of the Infinite deſire God has to unite himſelf to them, and of the perfect correſponding and complyance they are from thence oblig'd to, eſpecially ſuch Souls as are choſen, and in a particular manner called to this ſtate, that after all this it is ſcarce poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to reſiſt ſuch cogent impulſes and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractives of God. They make one deſire to die to all things, the better to prepare for ſo great a work of Love; the hurries and buſineſs of the World is not to be any longer endured, and one becomes paſſionately in Love with Solitude. My Soul, reflect diligently upon the Grace is given thee, and correſpond to the Love of God towards thee, which thou art now ſo thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted with: Thou haſt no other buſineſs but this; for thou muſt never betake thy ſelf to
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:57606:166"/> any other imployment, unleſs thou receive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs orders from God for it.</p>
                  <p>The more one is eſtranged from Creatures, the better a Soul is diſpoſed to this Divine Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherefore Diſgraces ought to be our Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, becauſe they are the means to obtain it. The <hi>Croſs,</hi> Purity of Love, Union, God alone: Theſe are the degrees that Grace leads us through, and our Fidelity calls us to.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo another good method of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Thanks after <hi>Communion,</hi> which conſiſts in abandoning and reſigning our ſelves abſolutely and without reſerve to the power and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Jeſus Chriſt, who coming into our hearts, ought to be maſter there, and command as Soveraign. When it pleaſes him to continue with a Soul, to entertain her, and to unite her to him by a moſt delightful feeling of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, we muſt not think that to remain thus united, is to do nothing; for 'tis the doing of all that God demands of us, and the co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with him in the greateſt work of Grace, which is the Union of a Soul with the Divinity. This Union is a repoſe of the Soul, and it is found in ſeveral and different manners: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is diffus'd through all the Soul, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times 'tis only in the Superiour part thereof; other while it reſtrains it ſelf to the ſupream point of the Will; and if the Soul be Faithful, ſhe does not conſiderably interrupt this Union: For the trouble of the Interiour part, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions of the imagination, may indeed leſſen the tranquility thereof, but cannot deſtroy it. The thing that weakens it the moſt, and as it
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:57606:167"/> were ſmothers it, are the Paſſions when vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, Cares that touch one to the quick, Troubles of mind, Pleaſures of Senſe; Wherefore one muſt be dead to all theſe, and endeavour to die perpetually to them.</p>
                  <p>Another time Jeſus entring into my Soul in <hi>Communion,</hi> did not impart to it this Union ſo deſirable, but deprived it of it; whether it were in puniſhment for her Imperfections, or that he deſigned her at that time for other Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and required Exteriour Duties from her for the good of her Neighbour. Her buſineſs was then to remain in Peace, and to make a free offering of the moſt noble thing in the World (to wit, the enjoyment of God) to God himſelf, who takes an Infinite delight to ſee himſelf thus Honoured by his Creature. And he is often pleas'd to be Glorified in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by perfect Souls, and the Souls find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves raiſed to a very ſublime Purity by theſe ſorts of Sacrifice, wherein they renounce the moſt dear Careſſes of God, to abandon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more purely to God, and to adhere to him only. O how true is it, that in the fund of the heart the moſt noble operations of Love are performed, hidden from all the World, and known to God alone. Even the Soul it ſelf does not know the Interiour Communications of God, till after long experience, which renders her ſelf skilful in the ſecrets of the Super-natural Life, whether neither Senſe nor Reaſon can pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate.</p>

                  <p>When therefore Jeſus enters into us by the <hi>Holy Communion,</hi> he brings with him all his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents &amp; all his Inclinations, particularly thoſe which he affects moſt, and deſires to imprint them in our Souls, for which purpoſe he gives himſelf to us under the form of nouriſhment; becauſe, as the meat we take, communicates to
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:57606:168"/> the Body all its principal qualities, ſo he inſpires the Soul withall its principal motions and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. And this is the reaſon that the oftner one Communicates, the more one ought to be penetrated with the Sentiments and Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Jeſus; that is to ſay; ſo much more one ought to Love Sufferings and Humiliations: The property of the <hi>Communion,</hi> which is the Living Bread which deſcended from Heaven, is not to be changed into us, as the inanimate Bread, that comes from the Earth, is, but to change us into Himſelf. And the <hi>Holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> ſhould raiſe man above his Natural Love, to lift him up to the Love of God, and to a perfect union with his Will, by Mortification and Deſtruction of Himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The moſt inward and moſt Perfect of all the Unions that a Creature can have with his God, is the Perſonal or Hypoſtratical one, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the Sacred Humanity of Jeſus, a Love of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and of the Poverty: Inſomuch, that it was no ſooner Divinely aſſumed, but it was inflamed with the Love of Suffering, and eſteemed nothing, next to the Divinity, ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy an bbject of Love as the <hi>Croſs.</hi> Now it is evident, that we cannot arrive to any Union with God ſo much reſembling the Hypoſtatical Union, as that which we obtain by the <hi>Holy Communion:</hi> Whence it follows that it ought to produce in us ſuch Inclinations as very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble thoſe which the Union Hypoſtatical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the Sacred Humanity; that is to ſay, it ſhould incline us to Love the <hi>Croſs,</hi> Poverty, Humiliations, and all other manner of Sufferings.
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:57606:168"/> O my Soul, where are we? How comes it about that we Communicate ſo often, and feel ſtill ſuch repugnance to ſuffer? Jeſus Chriſt coming into us, and, as I may ſay, again Incarnate in us, would not he confer the moſt ſignal Grace of Love of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> if he found us well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to receive it? He that Communicates often, and yet is unwilling to ſuffer, without doubt Communicates but imperfectly: For he does not receive the principal effects of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine union, which are, to make us love what Jeſus loved the moſt of any thing in the World. O my God, how long ſhall we live in the low Sentiments of Nature? Give me, to ſuffer, or to die. O my Soul, be aſhamed to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Suffering, for That, methinks, is to live without Love.</p>
                  <p>The Fruit which we gather from the <hi>Holy Communion,</hi> is not diſcerned by abundance of ſenſible ſweetneſs, or by reception of much Light in the underſtanding, but by a firm and vigorous reſolution of the Will to ſuffer and to mortifie it ſelf; and the more one advances in Mortification, the more one alſo increaſes in purity of Love. Jeſus, who is the nouriſhment of our Love in Heaven, where Love will be Infinitely pure, is likewiſe the nouriſhment of our Love upon Earth, (in the <hi>Bleſſed Sacrament,)</hi> which by conſequence ought to be Soveraignly pure, I mean, without any mixture of any thing that is not God. But this cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dying to all Creatures, and even to our Selves; and this Death is not compaſſed but by Mortification, and all that which Crucifies Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>AFter <hi>Holy Communion,</hi> it ſeemed to me that as Jeſus received of his Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Fullneſs of Light and true Love, in the Hypoſtatical Union, ſo he makes his Friends partakers thereof in the Sacramental Union; and thereby lays an obligation upon them to live by the ſame Life, to guide themſelves by the Light, and to enter into a Comformity to all his States. This Divine Light diſcovered to me a great many Verities very important for my direction and conduct.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That we are never to be without Sufferings: For the Spirit of Chriſtianity is the Spirit of the <hi>Croſs:</hi> The Grace that feeds and ſupports it, is the Fruit of the <hi>Croſs;</hi> and the adorable Bread ſo full of Delights, inſpires no other Sentiments then thoſe of the <hi>Croſs; Venite mittamus lignum in Panem ejus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That as Jeſus manifeſts the Purity of the Love he bears us, by dying for us upon the <hi>Croſs;</hi> ſo ought we to prove the Sincerity of ours, by nailing it to the <hi>Croſs.</hi> 3 That he work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Salvation by the only means of Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: Therefore it is a manifeſt deceit to hope that we can co-operate towards our Salvation by any other means than that of Suffering. 4. That we muſt attend and harken very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to the Spirit of Jeſus within us, which
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:57606:169"/> of it ſelf ſometimes furniſheth us with <hi>Croſſes</hi> of Providence, or elſe inſpires us to ſeek them of our ſelves. We muſt embrace them all cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, or ſearch them amorouſly. 5. That no other Soul but what is in Love with Croſſes, can taſt the ways of the Spirit and its Heavenly Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: For God who mixes the Pleaſures of Worldlings with wormwood and Gall, does often ſweeten our Sufferings after an admirable manner.</p>
                  <p>Moreover I was taught in the <hi>Holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> that Jeſus is a <hi>Sun,</hi> which was Eclipſed during this tranſitory Life, but now ſhines in Heaven full of Luſtre and Glory. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the meaſure Souls partake of his Eclipſe and Darkneſs, they ſhall proportionably ſhare of his Splendours in Glory. Why then flee we Poverty, Contempt and the <hi>Croſs?</hi> For that which Eclipſeth a Soul, with Jeſus Chriſt, is the Seed of an Immenſe Glory in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>What is the reaſon that we ſee nothing but <hi>Croſſes</hi> in Churches? All the <hi>Altars</hi> are adorned with the <hi>Croſs,</hi> the <hi>Prieſt</hi> going to Celebrate weares the <hi>Croſs</hi> in his Veſtments; while he is ſaying <hi>Maſs;</hi> while he is ſaying <hi>Maſs,</hi> he makes a great many Signs of the <hi>Croſs;</hi> when he is about to Communicate to us, he firſt gives us his Benediction with the Sign of the <hi>Croſs;</hi> even the laſt Action he does, holding the <hi>Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> in his Hand, and ready to preſent it to us, is forming the Sign of the <hi>Croſs</hi> with the <hi>Sacred Hoſt.</hi> We are told alſo, that in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient times, when Chriſtians received it in their Hands, they placed them in form of a <hi>Croſs,</hi>
                     <pb n="318" facs="tcp:57606:170"/> laying the Right Hand a Croſs over the Left: What can we learn from all this, but that the Chriſtian who Communicates, ought to be Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified? and that as he receives his God among <hi>Croſſes,</hi> ſo he ſhould take delight in paſſing his Life amongſt Sufferings.</p>
                  <p>My Soul, when ſhall I begin the practice of a Life wholly Crucified, a throughly Chriſtian and Supernatural Life? When ſhall I love Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, Contempt, Affronts, Injuries; O my God, that I might begin this very day to ſerve you, and trample upon all the Sentiments of Nature, which ought to be continually up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Croſs?</hi> And therefore I ought not to be troubled at ſuch things as impoveriſh and ruine me: The more poor, the more dead one is to the World. I ought even exteriourly, (if People would believe me,) to live poorly, and become vile and contemptible in the eyes of men, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the example of Jeſus Chriſt, who lived thirty years in a Shop like a Servant. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is my Duty to tend contrary to all that which the World, with its Wiſdom of the Fleſh eſteemeth: And that ſuddenly, for I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready grown Old, and have not yet begun. In becoming wretched according to the opinion of the World, I ſhall anſwer the Grace of my Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, who am called to Poverty and a Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Life. I ſhall obtain Peace, and become a man of Prayer. Aſſiſt me with your Powerful Graces, O Jeſus, and grant me Perſeverance.</p>
                  <p>Let us follow Jeſus, O my Soul; He, from the very firſt inſtant of his Life, walked like a Gyant in the ways of Humiliations and Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:57606:170"/> the ways that his Father appointed him: All his concern was to co-operate with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Eternal purpoſes which regarded himſelf. Let us walk couragiouſly in the rough and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Paths which Jeſus has traced out; Let us not fear our Natural Weakneſs, ſince he did not fear his Humanity, but ſhew'd himſelf obedient even to Death, and to the Death of the <hi>Croſs.</hi> Let us count every thing Folly that is contrary to this Wiſdom; and let us quit, one for all, every thing elſe to follow none but him.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THe following conſideration after <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> entertained me long, and continued a whole Morning: That the principal Effect of <hi>Communion</hi> is to produce in us an intimate Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Jeſus. This Union is a perfect Aſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his States and Myſteries. And this Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation is the ſame thing which they call a Transformation into God, and renders a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wholly Divine, and devoted to the Intereſts of God, inſomuch that by Grace he becomes Divine, as having no other Inclinations then thoſe of God, living by the Life of God, and deſiring nothing but the Love and Glory of God.</p>
                  <p>In this ſight which appeared to me very clear, I beheld the lowneſs and imperfections
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:57606:171"/> of ſuch Sentiments and Actions as are meerly Natural; I wondered at the blindneſs of men, who ſet ſuch a value upon an operation of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though it be of it ſelf ſo infinitely vile and contemptible. It ſeems they never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the importance of advancing towards Perfection with all their ſorce, nor the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition of an imperfect Soul. This Light wonderfully ſeparated me from Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and I am now as full of Horror of it, as I was formerly full of Sin. It ſeemed to me that Jeſus, who ſo prodigiouſly debaſeth himſelf in the <hi>Bleſſed Sacrament,</hi> by a Miracle of Love, of Mercy, and of incomparable bounty, did thus excite me to riſe from Nature to Grace, and and from a Humane, to a Super-natural Life: Towards which I felt in my ſelf ſuch ſtrong In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and ſuch powerful Obligations, by my frequent Communions, that I had rather have died, than have paſſed one moment of my Life in the ſtate of Nature.</p>
                  <p>We ought to tend inceſſantly to the Purity of Jeſus, and if to enter into it more readily and more perfectly, one muſt quit Honours, Goods and Friends, let us quit them, my Soul, and take in their places, Poverty, Contempts and Pains. The Purity of Virtue charms me and animates me to purſue it: I do not find any Creatures that I do not willingly abandon, nor any difficulty that I do not eaſily conquer.</p>
                  <p>O my God, ſeparate me by your Holy Grace from every thing which hinders this Divine Transformation; and grant that I may ceaſe to be what I am according to Nature, that I may
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:57606:171"/> become what you are by the power of Grace. When ſhall I be wholly united and transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into you? When ſhall I quite forget my ſelf, and be no more, and act only in you, and you in me, <hi>(in me manet, &amp; ego in eo:)</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue thus Abſorped in you all the days of my Life? Being thus united with you, I ſhall learn your ſecrets, diſcover your purpoſes, and ſee, with you and your Lights, the ways that you take to Love, Honour, and Glorifie your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which he revealed unto you at the inſtant of your Incarnation. Ever ſince that Happy minute you are become the Light of the World; he that will follow you, ſhall not walk in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Who can know the Secrets of the Father better than the Son; or his Deſigns and Thoughts, than he, who being equal to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is privy to all the Sacred Councels of the Divinity? Theſe he teaches us by word of Mouth, he opens them to us by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment and examples of his Life. Let us ſee, approve, imitate: Herein conſiſts the right Transformation.</p>
                  <p>The Grace beſtowed on us in the <hi>Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> principally tends to annihilate in us all inclinations of Nature; and in their place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduceth others moſt conformable to thoſe of Jeſus Chriſt; according to the meaſure that a Soul conforms to Jeſus Chriſt, proportionally ſhe becomes more capable of Divine Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications: For a Soul grows not more pure, but in as much as ſhe participates of the Spirit of the word <hi>Incarnate,</hi> whoſe whole aim is to Crucifie us to all that is meerly according to the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:57606:172"/> Inclinations of Nature. How different is the judgment and diſcernment of true Chriſtians from thoſe of Worldly men! How quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing are the Thoughts and Convictions of an Illuminated perſon, and thoſe of one who lives only according to Reaſon! There are Souls upon which, Jeſus, entring into them by way of <hi>Communion,</hi> makes ſuch admirable impreſſions, that Lead turned into the fineſt Gold by the <hi>Philoſophers-Stone,</hi> would not be more changed than they are. For in effect this Sacrament is the Myſtery of the Omnipotence of God where the words of Conſecration, by a Miraculous Power change the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine into the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt: By which mutation we are inſtructed that under the weak and common <hi>Species</hi> lyes a ſecret Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which is able to transform the moſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Souls into the greateſt Servants of God.</p>
                  <p>One of the things in the World that moſt aſtoniſheth me, is, that when we receive Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus in the <hi>Holy Communion</hi> we are ſo little chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and his Preſence ſo un-active in us. We experience none of his wondrous operations. He ought to be to the Soul a grain of good Seed, that makes very great productions. Jeſus ought to do admirable things, Jeſus ought to form Jeſus in us, and produce by his Grace all his own Sentiments, and fill our Life with all the States of his: Yet he makes no change in me; he does not ſtrip me of my Humane Inclinations, that I may live the Life of Jeſus: A thing which frights me very much, and gives me reaſon to fear that I do not approach unto him
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:57606:172"/> with all the preparation requiſite: Whereupon I flee to the Mercy of God, and beg it with all inſtance, for in that alone is my Hope.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THe deſign of our Lord in giving us the <hi>Bleſſed Sacrament,</hi> is layd open to us in the Prayer he made to God the Father while he was actually Inſtituting it: <hi>Rogo Pater, ut ſint unum: I ask you, That they may be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion that is between us.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Union he enjoys with God the Father, is the model of that which he deſires we ſhould contract with him by means of this <hi>Divine Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</hi> Now He is ſo much one with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that whoſoever ſees Him, ſees alſo His Father: And if we were transformed into Jeſus Chriſt, according to his intention in the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> whoſoever ſhould ſee us, would at the ſame time ſee Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But this Conſummate Alliance with God is not diſcernable in the moſt of thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Communion:</hi> Becauſe that Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation pre-ſuppoſes another, which fails in the greater part of Communicants, <hi>viz.</hi> The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of the Soul in Jeſus Chriſt; which is then obtained, when by the attractions of Grace ſhe is wholly annihilated as to her Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inclinations, and the Super-natural ſucceed in their place, being cleared from all diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:57606:173"/> but thoſe of the word <hi>Incarnate.</hi> A Soul in this ſtate, receiving the <hi>Holy Communion,</hi> ought to remain ſimply united to Jeſus preſent, and receive in quietneſs and tranquility ſuch effect of Grace as he works in her; which are, to live no longer to, or in her ſelf, but to enter effectively into the poor and abject ſtate of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, to live like Him, to live by his Spirit, to live no longer as the World, nor by the Spirit of the World.</p>
                  <p>Moreover the Union of the Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature in the Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, is another moſt expreſſive Image of the Union he aſſumes us to by the Virtue of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For we aſſuredly believe, that his Sacred Humanity is wholly abſorpt and plung'd in the Divinity, after ſuch an unſpeakable manner, that there is no compariſon which can be drawn from any Created thing, may ſerve to illuſtrate it. To compare it with the Stars which are loſt and drowned in the Light of the <hi>Sun,</hi> is a too weak and imperfect ſimilitude, and falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſhort; for there is an immenſe diſtance and diſproportion between Divine and Created things. But the Soul needs not ſuch alluſions; ſhe is contented to behold it in God by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurer Light of Faith, and thereupon falls into Acts of Admiration, Adoration and Love: and diſcerning that the intention of Jeſus Chriſt, by uniting himſelf to her in the <hi>Bleſſed Sacrament,</hi> is to perfect her in himſelf, ſhe accepts of it joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and reſigns her ſelf entirely to the Divine operation, and wiſhes ſhe could ſay with St. <hi>Paul, Vivo ego, jam non ego, vivit verò in me</hi>
                     <pb n="325" facs="tcp:57606:173"/> 
                     <hi>Chriſtus; I am no more, I live no more; but Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is my Life and my Being.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now it is evident that this high and Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Perfection is the effect of an eminent Love, and that it cannot be raiſed to ſuch a degree, without deſtroying in the Lover every thing that is not God, and by conſequence it coſts Nature dear, and requires a firm and generous Soul, and very Faithful to the impreſſions of Grace. Light and Knowledge are ineffectual of themſelves to this great work: Nothing but the real and earneſt practice of pure Virtue, in the full extent of the Grace given us, and as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhall afford the exerciſe, can bring a Soul to this eminent Perfection.</p>
                  <p>Such a Soul cannot be more charmed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, than to obſerve the amorous inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Wiſdom and Mercy of God, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving upon Chriſtians the Fulneſs of his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by means of the <hi>Bleſſed Sacrament,</hi> where Jeſus Chriſt preſents us his Humanity, to draw us into partake of his Divinity. O how great is the dignity of pure Souls when they Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate! O how low and abject are all the Grandeurs of the World! They are a meer No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing compared with this. For what Glory is comparable to that of a Soul intimately united with the Supream Being! My God, how delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and tranſporting is the ſight of the Wonders and profound Secrets wrapt up in your My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries; how they penetrate the Soul you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe them to!</p>
                  <p>This Union with Jeſus in <hi>Communion</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſable. For as the Father and the Son are one
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:57606:174"/> in Unity of Eſſence; the Word and Humane Nature one in Unity of Perſon; ſo the Soul that is one in Jeſus, partakes of both the Unions, Divine and Humane. Jeſus is in her according to both his Natures; and ſhe is All in Jeſus; and while ſhe does all things in him, he works all in her, he Prayes, Adores, Loves, Suffers, Labours; inſomuch, that this perfect Union produces a certain Unity between God, Jeſus, and the Soul, and between all their operations. It ſettles a kind of Partnerſhip and Community of Goods and Poſſeſſions between them: In a word it imports more than can be expreſſed. Now this condition muſt needs be moſt Holy and Divine, where God works in the Soul, and the Soul in God; <hi>In me manet, &amp; ego in eo:</hi> And the Alliance between them grows continually ſtreighter and cloſer, proportionably to her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſings in Virtue in this Life, and receives its ultimate Perfection only in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>O amiable Jeſus, with what a profuſion of Goodneſs and Love you entertain our Souls in this Sacrament? You conceal your Preſence under the External <hi>Species,</hi> to give us occaſion and advantage to exerciſe our Faith, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds you ſo much more clearly, as you are more ſecretly and obſcurely preſent. Again, on the other ſide you manifeſt and ſhew your ſelf by innumerable effects of your Grace and Divine Sentiments which you breath in the Soul; to excite and exerciſe our Love. What can a Soul do, when ſhe ſees her ſelf ſo preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo convinced, ſo preſſed by evident inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and experimental proofs of your endleſs and
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:57606:174"/> unwearied Bounty? What can ſhe do but Love, Love without ſtint, render Love for Love? how many excellent things might be ſaid upon this Subject! But how can thoſe Sentiments be expreſſed, that can hardly be conceived!</p>

                  <p>OFtentimes before and after <hi>Communion,</hi> I was taken up with Contemplating the Perfections of God.

                  <p>Each of theſe Perfections eſpouſe the Intereſts, and put on the Inclinations of Love, which are Liberality and Magnificence, and accordingly operate in a Soul, when Love makes his trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant

Thus in <hi>Communion</hi> a Soul does not only receive the impreſſions of Love, but of Love attended with the Luſtre and Excellencies of all the Divine Perfections.</p>
                  <p>It is obſervable, that Jeſus Chriſt, together with his Eternal Father, ſent the Holy Ghoſt upon the Apoſtles to repleniſh them with Love; in the ſame place where he had given them Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> So that this Divine Sanctuary was choſen two ſeveral times to be the Theater where the two greateſt Actions of Love were repreſented, that ever the goodneſs of God exhibited, out of himſelf. The firſt, in giving us his Son to reſide in our Hearts, who from all Eternity reſts in his own Boſom, and thereby enabling us to live Divinely by him, as he lives by his Father. The ſecond, in ſending on us the adorable Spirit of the Father and the Son, to be the knot of the Eternal Eſpouſals of the Soul with her God, to Beautify her with his In created Light, to warm her with his Sacred Flames, to animate her with his Heavenly Force and Virtue; and in a word to render her entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spiritual. And both theſe Actions are perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated in the Holy Church, when at the ſame
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:57606:175"/> time we are Feaſted with the precious Body of the Son of God, and inebriated with the Spirit of his Love.</p>
                  <p>O who can conceive the admirable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and Careſſes that are interchanged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Jeſus Chriſt and pure Souls in this <hi>Divine Sacrament!</hi> The World, which diſcerns nothing but by meditation of the Senſes, is too groſs and ſtupid to comprehend them. It thinks that Souls which are eſcaped from its ſnares, and diſ-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged from its buſineſs, lead an idle and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Life; it fancies they do nothing, becauſe their Actions are not ſeen; that their Fire is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, becauſe it does not blaze in the eyes of Men. But on the contrary, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble thoſe Mountains full of <hi>Sulpher,</hi> which carry vaſt Globes of Fire in their Boſomes, though they break out but at certain times, and then they are not only ſeen, but whole Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces feel the Conflagrations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Towns and Villages are Burned, and Fields covered with Aſhes. In like manner thoſe retired Souls which burn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly with Divine Love, and for the moſt part ſhine only to God and themſelves, yet when the command and ſervice of the Lord excite them to External Duties, they produce ſuch extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Effects, that numbers of Souls are ſet on fire with their Virtues, Example and Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In this kind we have had many great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, who having conceived a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand good deſires in their retirement, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with Heavenly fire by the frequent uſe of the moſt <hi>Holy Communion,</hi> iſſue from their retreat and this Sacred Table, like Lyons, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:57606:176"/> nothing but flames, and ſetting all on fire about them. Such have made the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions of Sinners, changed the face of whole Provinces and Kingdoms; and all this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed only by one, or a ſmall number of ſuch Servants of God, who appeared ſo powerful in Works and Words, that all their Actions ſeemed to be ſo many Miracles.</p>
                  <p>Here we muſt obſerve that this Interiour Fire in a perſon not ſufficiently retired within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or that from time to time is not careful to lay on more Fewel to nouriſh it, I mean, to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate his Heart by frequent Prayer to God, and Contemplation of his Divine Perfections, or that diſſipates his Spirit abroad by the impulſes of Nature, engaging himſelf in Temporal Affairs, without being called thereto by the Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and guidance of Grace, though ſomething of zeal appear in the thing, and (as one thinks) a good intention: I ſay, this Interiour Fire in ſuch a Perſon, is to be compared to theſe <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors</hi> or <hi>Lambent</hi> Fires, which are carried about with every motion of the Air, and ſhine, but do not burn.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>ONe day as I entred into a Church, I heard them ſing theſe words in Honour of the <hi>Bleſſed Sacrament; Ambulavit in fortitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne cibi illius uſ<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> ad montem Dei. He walked in the ſtrength of this Bread, even to the Mount of God.</hi> Theſe words affected me, and made me Hope, that notwithſtanding my Miſeries and continual weakneſs, I might be ſo ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by receiving this Divine Bread, that at laſt I might arrive to the Mount of God, might raiſe my ſelf above the low inclinations of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and mount to the participation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Jeſus; and Perfection of a Super-natural Life; which Life is a high Mountain, which no body can climb by the meer ſtrength of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>I obſerved before, that the peculiar intention of Jeſus in Inſtituting the <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> was to give us a foundation to Life and Strength; and for that reaſon 'tis the only <hi>Sacrament</hi> that is given in the form of Nouriſhment. The reſt are preſcribed by way of Remedy, to purge the Soul from Sin; or conferr'd by Ceremony of <hi>Couſecration,</hi> to dedicate the Perſon to the peculiar Duties of Religion and Holy Things, and ſo others reſpectively; But this is the only
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:57606:177"/> one given by way of Heavenly nurture, to enable us to live by the Life of Grace, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Life, over which the death of Sin has no power. For Jeſus Chriſt, among other effects of this Divine Food, aſſures us that it beſtows Eternal Life: <hi>Qui manducat hunc pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, vivet in aeternum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it ſeems very reaſonable and conform to the Infinite Goodneſs of God, that the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent of <hi>Sacraments</hi> ſhould confer the moſt excellent of Graces, which is that of Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. A Grace ſo Sublime, ſo Divine, ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, that we cannot merit it by any or all the good Actions we can do. But how rare and how noble ſoever it be, we have much ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to hope, that the Father of Mercies, and God of all Conſolations, will grant us it, ſince he has already enriched us with that which is Infinitely more than this Grace, the Prefence of his only Son in the <hi>Bleſſed Sacrament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Corporal Nutriment is Elementary and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, and therefore no better than Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Yet if the Body could take it always in a juſt proportion, and were perfectly well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to draw the ſtrength it affords, it would continue our Natural Life, and we ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver die. How much more would the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bread, the Living Bread, which contains in it ſelf the ever-flowing ſources of Life, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a perpetuity and infectibility of Spiritual Life by Grace, if the Soul duly uſed, and were diſpoſed to receive the abundance of Graces, Virtues and Super-natural ſtrength that this adorable Food brings with it? When we Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:57606:177"/> we drink of the ſame Fountain the Bleſſed do in Heaven. But to them it is the Water of Life Everlaſting; and what elſe can it be to us but that of the Life of never failing Grace, which is the pledge and aſſurance of the Eternity of Glory?</p>
                  <p>O my Soul, doſt thou think that any of the Bleſſed in Heaven, after they have taſted the Delights of that Torrent of Pleaſures, can be oloy'd with them, or be contented to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of that Divine and Happy Life? How then canſt thou be ſo unconſtant and irreſolute in the way of Grace, and unfaithful in the Union thou haſt contracted with God, who haſt drank the Waters of Joy from the ſame Fountains of thy Saviour? When he preſents himſelf really and in Perſon, and demands to be admitted into thy Heart, ſay not to him as St. <hi>Peter</hi> did, <hi>Retire from me, O Lord;</hi> But breath out the Sentiments of perfect Love, ſaying with the Spouſe; <hi>Tenui eum nec dimittam: I will never abandon him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O what a pleaſant Society, how profound a Peace does the enjoyment of the Soveraign Good bring to the Soul! But both imperfect, till they are finiſhed in Heaven, The fulleſt poſſeſſion thereof ſhe can acquire on Earth, ſerves only to inflame her thirſt more; the more ſhe taſts God, the more ſhe deſires him; and ſince there is no poſſibility of ſatisfying her deſire in this Life, ſhe ſuffers a continual Martyrdom that makes her both die and live together, Her pain is full of ſweetneſs, and that ſweetneſs begets a languiſhing and longing
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:57606:178"/> after her Beloved. She is diſguſted with all created things, and forceably drawn off from them. Nothing pleaſeth her in this condition, but that which augments her flame. She can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not read with ſatisfaction, unleſs there be ſome mention of her Beloved. All Converſation and Diſcourſe are burthen ſome and tedious, unleſs the ſubject be his Love.</p>
                  <p>My God, you ſee the bottom of my Heart. I conceive things that I cannot utter. 'Tis true I ſuffer, but I would not but ſuffer. I can do nothing but aſpire to a fuller poſſeſſion of your Infinite Goodneſs. 'Tis very much that you vouchſafe to give your ſelf unto me in the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sacrament with ſuch an immenſe Love; but ſtill you give me only a hidden Treaſure. I poſſeſs you indeed; but do not enjoy you to my hearts deſire. I am in the condition of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Simeon,</hi> who held you in his Arms in the Temple, and yet dyed with a deſire to ſee you. It is time, O Lord, now permit my Soul to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part in Peace, and quit this Mortal Life, becauſe I receive within me the Spring and Source of Immortality. I know for certain that in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice I ſhall obtain the perfect accompliſhment of all my Deſires; yet I do not deſire it till it be your good will and Pleaſure. Your Love makes me preſs forward and tend inceſſantly to the Beatifical Union; but 'tis your Love too that ſtops my courſe, that draws me back, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring me with the higheſt indifference and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute dependance on your Divine Will.</p>
                  <p>O Jeſus how admirable is your Providence! you open my eyes to ſee the comfortable and
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:57606:178"/> Bleſſed ſight of the Power and Purity of Love which ought to poſſeſs the Soul that has the Happineſs to receive you often in the <hi>Holy Communion.</hi> I relinquiſh and reſign my ſelf more than ever into your Divine Hands, guide me as it ſhall beſt pleaſe you. There is nothing left to ask you more, ſince you have (unasked) beſtowed your ſelf upon me, and crowned me with Mercies, even beyond all my Hopes. My buſineſs is to remain annihilated in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and quietly receive your Divine In-acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and fulfilling your merciful intentions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, which are very great, and above the comprehenſion of him that receives them. For who can comprehend how the Infinite Majeſty of God ſhould lodge and be received in ſo vile, ſo ſtreight, ſo unworthy a place as the Heart of Man?</p>
                  <p>The coming of the Kingdom of God into a Soul, Sounds very delightfully, and ſeems ſweet; I, but the poor heart muſt firſt prepare to ſuffer the violent pains of a continual Agony. The heart where God Almighty reigns, muſt bid adieu to all Humane Life. She dies to all Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, to all Conſolations, even Divine: She has no more ſupport, no more relyance upon Creatures: even the moſt Holy: The bent of Nature and all Humane Inclinations are extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in her; ſhe has no more a mind for one thing than for another, unleſs it be for a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Indifference; nothing but Abjections, Annihilations, Poverty, De-reliction, are her Portion: She is not capable of any other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge than that of Jeſus Crucified; and her Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is Folly to this World.</p>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:57606:179"/>
                  <p> This is the manner I ought to depend on your Grace, O Bleſſed Jeſus, and have continual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe unto you. For you are my Father, who nouriſh me with your own Subſtance; you are my ſtrength, and ſupport my weakneſs: You are my Center, where all my Agitations and Inquietudes reſt, and are at an end: You are my End, and utmoſt term of all my Deſires. At preſent I have no clear ſight of the Purity of your Love; but only feel in my ſelf forceable Inſtincts that incline me to deſire the Purity of Love, and make me frequently break out into ſuch Expreſſions as theſe: O pure Love! O du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Love! Happy is he that ſeeks thee; more Happy he that has found and poſſeſſeth thee; But ah! incomparably moſt Happy, Happy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond meaſure he that Perſeveres with thee, and Dies in thy embraces!</p>

                  <p>I Eſteem it a great Happineſs when we ſuffer any thing for Gods ſake, there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on Earth, whereby we can better teſtifie the Honour and Love we have for him. 'Tis in this ſtate we are in a capacity to offer up to the Divine Majeſty excellent Sacrifices, and render to him moſt ſignal Services. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do more for a Friend than to procure his Glory by our own Deſtruction, and make our ſelves nothing to make him All. Hence it is that Saints have ſet up a higher value upon their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings in Priſons and Chains for the Name of Jeſus, than to be wrapt up with St. <hi>Paul</hi> into the third Heaven by Contemplation.</p>
                  <pb n="338" facs="tcp:57606:180"/>
                  <p> Be comforted then, O my Soul, in the different ſtates wherein thou findeſt thy ſelf, ſo it be that thou doſt ſuffer ſomething for God, it is enough. If thou haſt not the gift of Prayer, but art in in aridity of Spirit, ſuffer, and be content; there is more merit in this, than in the moſt raviſhing Contemplation. Art thou afflicted with Sickneſs, and ſo deprived of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Maſs,</hi> and receiving the <hi>Bleſſed Sacrament?</hi> Suffer and be content; for 'tis better to be in the rigours of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> than in the ſweets of Spiritual Exerciſes. If thou canſt do nothing for the good of thy Neighbour, ſuffer, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, for 'tis leſs meritorious to act for God, than ſuffer for him. If thy Exerciſes of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and good Deſigns do not ſucceed as thou expecteſt, ſuffer and be content, for 'tis better to ſuffer, then to have all things according to thy deſires. If thou haſt any deformity of Body, or no great Parts of Mind, provided thou ſuffer this Patience, no Perſon can do better, for this pleaſeth God. Believe me, the beſt Science in the World, the beſt Prayer, the greateſt Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, is to know how to ſuffer for Gods ſake.</p>
                  <p>We have a very great eſteem for the Wood of the <hi>Croſs</hi> of Chriſt; we ſearch after it with no ſmall diligence; no perſon can preſent us with a more precious Relique; We Encheſe it in Gold, we keep it near our Heart, we have a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration for it, and preſerve it Religiouſly; and not without reaſon, becauſe 'tis a ſmall Relique of the true <hi>Croſs</hi> of Chriſt: In like manner true Chriſtians, the Children of Light, do highly eſteem thoſe little Mortifications,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:57606:180"/> whether active or paſſive, they undergo, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing more precious upon Earth; and a greater guift cannot be preſented to them, then the occaſions to ſuffer and mortifie themſelves, which they embrace with Joy and Love, and with great reſpect cheriſh them, not near, but in their Heart; conſidering that the ſtate of Suffering is moſt agreeable to the diſpoſitions of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſome ſmall participation of his Sufferings. 'Tis as a little Parcel of the true <hi>Croſs,</hi> and the moſt precious Relique they can carry about them.</p>
                  <p>Let's never be without having with us ſome of the true <hi>Croſs;</hi> let us make much of what afflicts us, and we have Reliques thereof before we think on't. When we examine our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, let us ask our ſelves this queſtion: Haſt thou, O my Soul, any parcel of the true <hi>Croſs?</hi> Any Reliques of the Sufferings of Jeſus Chriſt? Happy are thoſe who have ſome part of them, for they enjoy the occaſions of the great tryals and proofs of their Love to Chriſt, as can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly happen. The flames of Divine Love burn brighteſt in the furnace of Affliction. St. <hi>Paul</hi> had a good piece of the true <hi>Croſs,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>He carried in his Body the Marks of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> for his Sufferings were indeed for Jeſus's ſake.</p>
                  <p>The moſt noble and glorious thing that Chriſt did upon Earth, was his Dying for us on the <hi>Croſs,</hi> a Death moſt Painful and Ignominious, that his Heavenly Father might thereby be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely Glorified; and he being thus exalted, might draw the hearts of Believers after him,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:57606:181"/> and more powerfully engage their Affections to love and adore him.</p>
                  <p>A Soul that beholds Jeſus on this Throne of his Ignominies, which indeed is the Throne of his Grandeurs, deſires here on Earth to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Jeſus Crucified, as the Saints in Heaven enjoy him Glorified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And thus ſhe breaths forth her Deſires: <hi>True it is, I cannot have a full Fruition of my Well-beloved in this Life; however this is my comfort, I can ſuffer for him. Enjoyment is more ſweet to the Creature, but ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is more lovely to the Creator; and ſo I find enjoyment of the Miſeries of my Baniſhment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When a Soul has no mind to ſuffer in this World, ſhe has no mind to belong to God: For ſeeing in this exile, we cannot be his by enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or but very little, and being not willing to appertain to him by Suffering, we cannot poſſeſs God: And being without God, we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to Creatures, and looſe our ſelves in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and vanity. God finds not out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a more pleaſing Manſion, than in a Soul and Body Mortified with Sufferings; there it is he takes his complacency and delight. The Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity repos'd with Infinite joy in the Humanity of Jeſus Chriſt in his Suffering ſtate: And a Soul never loves more, nor renders a greater homage to the Divine Perfections, than by the <hi>Croſs</hi> and Sufferings, Sacrificing her ſelf to Gods Intereſts and Glory. This then is the Motto of a loving Soul, <hi>Aut pati, aut mori, Jeſus let me ſuffer, or let me die.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. II. <hi>That we muſt have a Love for</hi> Croſſes.</head>
                  <p>A Life without a <hi>Croſs,</hi> is a Life without Love. This Saying (too common among us,) <hi>That we muſt live an eaſie Life;</hi> does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Lips of a Chriſtian, for 'tis all one as to ſay, <hi>We muſt live a Natural Sordid Life.</hi> Next to the Divinity, nothing is more amiable than the <hi>Croſs</hi> of Chriſt. We muſt either enjoy with the Divinity, or ſuffer with the Humanity: and the more we ſuffer with the one, the more we ſhall enjoy with the other. A Soul conducted by enjoyments, muſt alſo participate of great Sufferings, for theſe make thoſe more ſweet and pleaſant.</p>
                  <p>We find by experience that the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment taken in Creatures, does diminiſh Divine enjoyment; and therefore the Saints have been ſevere to themſelves, ſo as to allow Nature only what is purely neceſſary, by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute denyal even of Lawful Pleaſures. We too often enlarge the Law of neceſſity, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge our ſelves in our Refections and Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Accomodations. Nature is content with little; but the clamours of others, and the fear of prejudicing our Health, does us no ſmall hurt in our way towards Perfection.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a ſign we march couragiouſly in the way of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> when we find in our Souls ſuch a Peace and Serenity, that does not indeed hinder
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:57606:182"/> Nature to feel the bitterneſs of Sufferings, but inſpires with a generous reſolution to embrace and cheriſh them; looking upon them as ſpecial favours from Heaven, notwithſtanding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grets of Nature, to prove our Fidelity, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance our Glory.</p>
                  <p>It comes into my mind, that to take away the bitter taſt of <hi>Croſses,</hi> we muſt ſweeten them with ſeveral Sauces, that is, with different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiderations. Sometimes by accepting from Gods hand with a Spirit of Pennance: Other times with a Spirit of Sacrifice: And then again with the Spirit of pure Love: Sometimes to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to Jeſus Chriſt in his ſuffering ſtate; and beſides to do the Will of God, and ſubmit our ſelves with all Humility to the Orders of his Divine and Sacred Providence. Thus the Soul may make uſe of ſeveral conſiderations to ſweeten the bitterneſs of Sufferings; and ſo preſerve a Love of the <hi>Croſs</hi> among all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnances of Humane Nature.</p>
                  <p>When God deſigns to advance Divine Love in a Soul, he affords her great occaſions of Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by the order of his Providence, and ſhe contentedly embraces them, though very bitter to ſenſual Nature. Such favours are precious, and we ought to manage them with Prudence and Councel.</p>
                  <p>'Tis very true what our Bleſſed Saviour ſays in the <hi>Goſpel, Multi ſunt vocati, pauci verò electi: Many have calls to Perfection by Inſpirations, Lights and Motions of Grace;</hi> And yet they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive not to it, for want of Fidelity, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much ſparing themſelves by too tender a love
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:57606:182"/> of their Body, Goods, Friends and Relations, giving an ear more to Humane reaſon, than the voice of Grace.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes we perſwade our ſelves that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion is a Life full of Peace without <hi>Croſſes;</hi> but we deceive our ſelves; nor ought we to enter into the Service of God, without a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Indifferency to all ſtates; to be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified there, not as we would have it, but after what manner beſt pleaſes God, <hi>Croſſes</hi> from the immediate hand of God do much conduce to Sanctifie us; but what ariſe from our vanity, or too much love of the World, are for the moſt part unprofitable, and rather a hindrance to the Soul in her way to Perfection. Suffer we muſt, more or leſs, and what pleaſes God we muſt accept of with contentation.</p>
                  <p>O how rare is it to find Souls truly amorous of <hi>Croſſes?</hi> I am of Opinion that the little love we have for Sufferings, is the only cauſe we ſo little advance in the ways of Grace; and if we well examine our ſelves, we ſhall acknowledge it. The love of Sufferings is quite repugnant to our Natural Inclinations, but God can make that eaſie by Grace, which is impoſſible to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and if we ask this great Grace as we ought, we ſhall receive it as God has promiſed. Neither does the Love of the <hi>Croſs</hi> ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in great Corporal Auſterities, as embracing with an amorous generoſity all thoſe little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, Mortifications, and Humiliations we dayly meet withall, either from others, or our ſelves, or by the ſecret orders of Divine Providence; and to make good uſe of them for
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:57606:183"/> our Spiritual advantage, is not the work of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but of Grace.</p>
                  <p>The more perfect our Virtue is, the more we have a love for the <hi>Croſs,</hi> that we may be more conformable to our Bleſſed Saviour: Know we not, that they who will live Piouſly in Chriſt Jeſus, muſt ſuffer Perſecution? They ſhall ſuffer indeed on all ſides, from the Fleſh, from the Spirit, from the World; and God himſelf will try them with Afflictions. This on earth is the high way to Heaven, wherein Love muſt walk to come to Perfection; which can never be gain'd without a labourious and couragious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</p>

                  <p>WE muſt have a great Intellectual thirſt to ſuffer all ſorts of <hi>Croſſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> This is the Character of true Chriſtians, this is the Mark to know that Jeſus Crucified is eſtabliſh'd in us. And this thirſt ought to continue in us, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our condition be, becauſe it much aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments our Enjoyments and Conſolations. The more the Soul enjoyes, the more ſhe becomes thirſty, not only of a more Savorous Union, but alſo of a more heavy <hi>Croſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Jeſus Chriſt did thirſt after his Paſſion for us, and Dying on the <hi>Croſs</hi> his thirſt Increaſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not quenched with all his Sufferings. We ſay we ought to have the Image of Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:57606:183"/> Crucified imprinted on our Souls; and what is this but to have a thirſt for Sufferings as he had? O how the cup of affliction is pleaſant to a Soul athirſt for Sufferings? When ſome great <hi>Croſs</hi> happens to ſuch a Soul, ſhe finds comfort and ſatisfaction therein, as one enflamed with heat, is refreſh'd with Drinking.</p>
                  <p>God has a ſtrange thirſt for our Sufferings, he is a thirſt in us by the Fire of his Divine Love, wherewith he loves himſelf and his Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; why do we not refreſh him with our Sufferings? But alas! this Divine thirſt is little known to men, O how is it hidden from ſenſual eyes? O Jeſus, how little are you known! How little are you loved! Theſe Proceeding of Jeſus are not underſtood by thoſe who only follow the Light of Senſe and Reaſon. <hi>Emitte lucem tuam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Whence once the Spiritual man diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers this, nothing is more deſirable to him then Suffering.</p>
                  <p>The great deſire of the Bleſſed in Heaven is Enjoyment; but we Travellers on earth ought to deſire nothing more then to ſuffer for Jeſus. This Suffering does mortifie Old <hi>Adam</hi> in us by Holy Violence, makes us die to the World, and ſeparates from us whatever is Impure and Earthy, as Gold is purified in a burning Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace. Our Corruption cannot be ruin'd but either by Fire or the Sword of Afflictions; which ſhould induce us to embrace them with Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſeeing the more we Suffer, the more we are Purified. Let us have an Honourable eſteem for the greateſt <hi>Croſſes;</hi> becauſe they work in us the profoundeſt Purity, and the pureſt Love
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:57606:184"/> of God, which is the Life of our Soul, and the end of our Creation.</p>
                  <p>I am much pleas'd with my preſent ſtate of affliction, ſeeing it is the readieſt way to form Jeſus Chriſt in me, and make me a Perfect Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; which is the work of works, the higheſt Honour, the richeſt Treaſure, and the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Happineſs of this Life. While we are Pilgrims on Earth, we are exiles from Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Which muſt needs be a <hi>Croſs</hi> to Souls that ſigh after the Beatifical viſion. I know not how it is, but methinks, I ſee more Purity of Love, of reſignation, of Perfection in my preſent Suffering condition, then what I have found in the joyes of union, which puts my heart in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and quiet. It ſeems to me that I can ſay more truely than at other times, <hi>O my God, what do I deſire in Heaven or on Earth but you, who are my Portion, and my Heritage for ever?</hi> My Life is Crucified with Jeſus Chriſt, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together hid with him in the good Pleaſure of God.</p>
                  <p>To ſend us <hi>Croſſes,</hi> and make us content with a Suffering condition, is one of the choiceſt effects of the Providence of God. Seeing he has an Infinite Love for himſelf, his will is, that all Creatures capable of his Love, ſhould love him alſo. To diſpoſe them thereto the better, he ſends them <hi>Croſſes,</hi> which purifie our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Nature, and produce in us diſpoſitions fit for Divine Impreſſions.</p>
                  <p>O Infinite Goodneſs, O merciful Juſtice, I return you Thanks with all my Heart, that you have afflicted me, to make me love you. Loſſes,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:57606:184"/> Contempts, Poverty, Sufferings, come, you are welcome, my heart is open to give you entertainment; Behold, I receive you with open arms, becauſe you bring with you <hi>Divine Love.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>I Am much taken with this Saying of St. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>Alexandria; That ſeeing our Love and Fidelity to God does not at preſent appear by ſhedding our Blood for our Faith, the Perſecutions of Tyrants being ceas'd, we muſt now manifeſt them by making our Faith viſible in all our Actions.</hi> To do the will of God is a great teſtimony of our Love to him; but 'tis a far greater to ſuffer for him. Souls loving God, and beloved of him, are careful to correſpond to Divine Graces, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by acting or Suffering; and are ſo couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their Reſolutions, that no humane fears, though of loſs of Life it ſelf, is able to ſtop the torrent of their Affections. Witneſs that good Religious man, who askt his Spiritual Guide, whether it was not better to die, than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the Infirmarian, who provided Diet not proper for him.</p>
                  <p>We now ſuffer more notably in ſome things, than the Martyrs of Old by Bloody Perſecutors. For our <hi>Croſſes</hi> Interiour or Exteriour, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:57606:185"/> of the Divine Holineſs, though they ſeparate not the Soul from the Body, yet they ſeparate the Soul from the Love of all Creatures, to unite us to God alone. This Holineſs of God having an Infinite abhorrence of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not Pure and Holy, Delights to purifie the Elect by Tribulations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Gold in the Fire. When therefore the Soul feels her ſelf as it were nail'd to the <hi>Croſs,</hi> by Derelictions, Aridities, and Interiour Sufferings, let her not ſtrive to free her ſelf, but continue in this Suffering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly, as long as pleaſes God, becauſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhe Glorifies him, and Purifies her ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Seeing 'tis certain that the <hi>Croſs</hi> is the Source of Graces and Purity, we are inconſiderate to complain, and ſhun Afflictions, for we flee from our advancement in Spirituality, and the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Love; neither will we permit God to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh in us his good pleaſure. To die naked on the <hi>Croſs</hi> is the ultimate diſpoſition of pure Love, 'Tis in vain to pretend to the Perfection of Divine Love, unleſs with St. <hi>Tereſa, We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire either to die, or ſuffer.</hi> The Holy Martyrs could not attain it but by dying for God, nor we except by Suffering for him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>When I am in Prayer in the Preſence of God, I am much aſhamed of my ſelf, to ſuffer ſo little, and with ſo much Imperfection, in a manner ſo different from the Saints. I am in ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion hereat, that I dare hardly ſtay in Gods Preſence, were it not, that to repair my Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and make him ſatisfaction, I offer up to him Jeſus ſuffering, poor and abject for us ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. And thereupon I make reſolutions to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:57606:185"/> whatſoever <hi>Croſſes</hi> happen to me with all the Fidelity that Grace requires. It ſeems to me that a Soul can hardly be content without ſome Suffering or other. I have had experience hereof in ſome little tempeſt that now is over. And which is more, I cannot believe ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent may be taken in limiting our ſufferings, as deſiring greater, if God thinks good; becauſe the Peace and Content of the Soul conſiſts in Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Love is beſt ſatisfied with what moſt pleaſes God, and therefore in ſuffering for him:</p>
                  <p>From theſe words of our Bleſſed Saviour, <hi>If any one will come after me, he muſt deny himſelf, and take up his</hi> Croſs, <hi>and follow me:</hi> I learn that the ſtate of this preſent corrupt Life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that we muſt live in a continual dying to the World, ſeeing the enjoyment of Creatures does too much work upon our weakneſs, to bring us off from God. Our Corruption and the long habit of taking Pleaſure in the things of this World, makes it very difficult for us to live this dying Life, which is a great <hi>Croſs,</hi> and a long Martyrdom.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be denyed but we muſt ſuffer much to arrive to the poſſeſſion of God in a Super-natural Life; however to taſte the ſweetneſs of God for one moment, does Infinitely tranſcend the pains of gaining him. And when he hides himſelf, and tryes us with Derelictions, what a <hi>Croſs</hi> is it? 'Tis a ſtate of great Perfection in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to be content without Comforts, both Divine and Humane. Many Martyrs have ſuffered leſs in dying for God, then the Soul does ſometimes in this condition. Patience a little,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:57606:186"/> and God e'er long will ſufficiently recompenſe us with abundance of his Graces and Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes God ſeems to abandon his moſt Faithful Servants, as he dealt with Holy <hi>Job,</hi> permitting Satan to aſſault them with ſeveral Temptations; ſometimes againſt Charity, ſometimes againſt Chaſtity, and ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Faith. 'Tis true, theſe are <hi>Croſſes</hi> and Cruel Perſecutions, but if we bear them Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with Love, 'tis a Martyrdom pleaſing to God, and profitable to us. The Perſecuting Tyrants tempted the Primitive Chriſtians, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times againſt their Faith, ſometimes againſt their Chaſtity, which were Glorious Tryals of their Fidelity. O how Bleſſed a thing is it to fight for that Faith and Fidelity we owe to God? O what lovely Charms are there in this Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to thoſe who behold them with the eye of Faith?</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>BEing in a Friends Houſe who ſerved God truly, news was brought me, that the Soldiers had ceas'd upon all my Goods at home; and Bleſſed be God, it little troubled me. But rather I rejoyc'd, and put my ſelf into the Hands of God, to do what he pleas'd with me, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my Heart to undergo greater Loſſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly. I was much comforted by my Friend,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:57606:186"/> and I went home full of Joy and Cheerfulneſs, accounting my ſelf Happy that Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence had brought me to Poverty and Abjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And I ſaid with my ſelf: Courage my Soul, our Bleſſed Saviour continues his Mercies; Poverty and Abjection will afford us wings to flee to Perfection: Behold now is the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to make great Progreſs in Virtue, if we be but Faithful.</p>
                  <p>It ſeem'd to me that at this time few Perſons pityed me; and yet they talk'd of my Affliction as no ordinary Tryal. They blam'd me in ſome ſort of Proceedings; and after all I found my ſelf an Abject and little conſidered. I could never conſent to the Councel of thoſe, who would have me either yield to anger, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content: For I always thought, I ought not to part with that Meekneſs and Humility which becomes a Chriſtian, for the greateſt Temporal loſs that can happen to me.</p>
                  <p>I conſidered with my ſelf that theſe little <hi>Croſſes</hi> were hardly to be named with thoſe that they ſuffer, who are tormented with anguiſhes of Spirit, or thoſe who are Slaves under the <hi>Turk,</hi> or ſuch who are put to Death with grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Tortures. That which I ſuffer is nothing in compariſon of thoſe poor Creatures. For I, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being contriſtated by Suffering, found a certain joy to poſſeſs my heart, and a greater deſire to ſuffer more. Hereupon one told me, <hi>That our Saviour ſent me Croſſes adorn'd with Flowers;</hi> which, though they took not away their heavineſs, yet their Odours did refreſh and ſtrengthen me to bear them.</p>
                  <pb n="352" facs="tcp:57606:187"/>
                  <p> This Perſecution continuing, I found my ſelf always diſpoſed to ſuffer it with great Interiour Peace; and I kept my Soul from harbouring any thoughts of Bitterneſs againſt thoſe who aſſiſted my Plunderers. I Saluted them with a Cordial Love, although Nature had a repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to their Proceedings. I beheld with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment the Fall of our Family, how our Friends did forſake us, and ſome treat us very unworthily; and yet I could not think it a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, but a ſignal favour from the hand of Providence. And I did not complain, but digeſt all this bitter Cup with Interiour joy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O bona crux! O good Croſs!</hi> The words of St. <hi>Andrew</hi> ſeem'd to me very true. <hi>O how Croſſes are good, though full of Bitterneſs?</hi> We ought to love what is good, and make much of it: In reality, there's an exquiſite goodneſs in Sufferings, and the Fruit of the <hi>Croſs</hi> is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Savorous. For at laſt we ſhall find that the degrees of Glory, ſhall be according to the meaſure of our Sufferings and degrees of Love.</p>
                  <p>I was then told ſome means how to get out of this Suffering condition; Nature began to reſent this with ſome joy, but Grace repreſs'd it, ſtifling this emotion of Nature, that I might have no joy but in God alone, and in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of his good Pleaſure.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Diſpoſitions during Sickneſs, where the Body ſuffer'd and the Soul rejoyced.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>GOd has been pleas'd to make me enjoy, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my Sickneſs, an Interiour Peace ſo profound and great, that I was altogether aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd at it, conſidering my Miſeries and former Tranſgreſſions. I ſaid within my ſelf: What is this that I find within me? How comes it to paſs that ſo miſerable a Creature ſhould be thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and ſatisfied? For my Soul was in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect calm from all her Paſſions, feeling no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a pure and total union to the good pleaſure of God, and an abſolute abandon of my ſelf to the conduct of Divine Love.</p>
                  <p>It ſeemed to me that ſome dayes before this Sickneſs, I was in a diſpoſition of extraordinary Peace and Tranquility; and one day after Dinner I was taken with a continual Feaver, accompanied with much Head ach, and Pains throughout all my Body. But Divine Love, methoughts, continued his operations, and ſet me all a flame with Holy Fires. So that I often, cryed out, <hi>O Love! O Love! O Love!</hi> And could ſay nothing elſe.</p>
                  <p>When I ſeem'd as a dying man, my Friends weeping about me, and every one ſaying, <hi>I could hardly Recover;</hi> my Soul beheld all this without being touched with any Sentiments of regret, or tenderneſs for my Friends, being
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:57606:188"/> wholly taken up with Divine Love, which did ſo entirely unite me to the good Pleaſure of God, that methought I could never be ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from it.</p>
                  <p>'Twas no part of my care to beg for my Life; and one of my Friends propoſing to ſend me ſome Reliques of Saints, which had done Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Cures, I only thank'd him; for though I have no ſmall veneration for them, yet I had no mind to make uſe of them for my Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but I would wholly put my ſelf into the hands of Divine Love, and leaving my ſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to the conduct thereof, whether for Life or Death, for Time, or Eternity.</p>
                  <p>In this extreme weakneſs of Body, my Soul found her ſelf Victorious and Triumphant; to ſee that fall of Pain, and her ſelf full of Love; and inſtead of being compaſſionate, ſeem'd to me to ſmile at theſe Sufferings. This was an extraordinary effect of Love, that in this great weakneſs of Body, my Soul kept up her ſtrength, and eſpecially that the great Pains of my Head did not hinder her Interiour occupations.</p>
                  <p>This diſpoſition of Love continued as long as my Sickneſs; and I entertain'd my Friends with little conſideration, and I believe with too much talking, fearing now to have diſcover'd then too much thoſe Holy Fires that inflam'd my heart, and that Self-love made me declare too freely my inward feelings. My thoughts now make me ſuſpect this defect, but being inebria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Love, I ſaid I know not what; being like a drunken man, that for a time forgets his Poverty and Miſeries. So in this diſpoſition I
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:57606:188"/> forgot my Sins and extreme Frailties, and caſt my ſelf into the Arms of Love, that I might be united with my Well-beloved, and enjoy his Reciprocal embraces. I had a care to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine my conſcience, and confeſs my ſins as a dying man, and ſet in order my Temporal Affairs, to paſs to Eternity.</p>
                  <p>Finding my ſelf not able to give much to the Poor, it was a joy to me to die in Poverty; and I was as well content to give nothing, as if I had been able to beſtow much on pious uſes. The love of Jeſus, poor and deſpiſed did deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pierce my heart, and to ſatisfie my ſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, I made them bring to me a poor Infant, in whom methought I ſaw the Poverty of little Jeſus, and kiſſing his Hand, I rendred what ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage I could, deſiring to love poor Jeſus to my laſt breath. I acknowledge dear Jeſus, that I am very unworthy of your Divine ſtates. But alas! muſt I die without entring effectually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Poverty and Abjection of your Mortal Life? At leaſt, O good Jeſus, I die with that Love and Reſpect I ought to have for them; and be pleas'd to accept of that Conformity I deſire to have for them.</p>
                  <p>I remember that Praying on <hi>Sunday</hi> in the Evening, the day before I fell Sick, at the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi> Church, where I was at Veſpers, our Bleſſed Saviour put theſe words into my mind, <hi>Chriſto confixus ſum Cruci, I am faſtned to Chriſt on the</hi> Croſs. Whereupon I felt an ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to have not one moment of my Life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being able to ſay, <hi>I am Crucified with Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> I think this Divine Love did then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:57606:189"/> me to be nailed on the <hi>Croſs.</hi> And in effect, my Sickneſs beginning with a grievous Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, which made my eyes to be ſwoln with pain, it came into my mind, that I might on this occaſion Honour the crowning of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour with Thorns. And it was ſome Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to me to have any conformity to this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous ſtate of Jeſus. And as my pain did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to all parts of my Body, I imagin'd it had ſome little reſemblance to the ſtate of a Body Crucified.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have an account of my diſpoſitions in this Sickneſs, which I have done in obedience to the command impoſed on me. Perhaps they are explicated with too much advantage, but the relation is true as to the ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>Bleſs therefore with me the God of Mercies, who has been pleas'd to be ſo bountiful to his moſt ungrateful Creature; but it be-ſeem'd his Goodneſs to glorifie his Mercies by the greatneſs of my Miſeries. This then is my comfort, and I cannot but declare his bounties to me, and ſay, <hi>Venite, &amp; videte omnes qui timetis Deum, quanta fecit Dominus animae meae. Come all ye that fear God and ſee what great things he hath done for my Soul.</hi>

                  <p>I Began to go out of that ſtate, wherein I had been more than five Weeks. My corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Body did bring down the Soul as it were to nothing; ſo that I had much ado, either to know or love God; of whom, methought, my Soul had little or no remembrance. Seeing my ſelf in this ſtate of Incapacity, I remain'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other proſpect but of my own nothing, and depth of my Miſeries; being amazed at the ſtrange weakneſs of a Soul, when left to her ſelf. This thought which wholly took up my Soul, proceeded from a certain experience, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than any Light in the underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>'Till God brought my Soul to this point, ſhe did not well know her own weakneſs; but now ſhe diſcover'd a thouſand falſe Opinions and vain eſteems ſhe had of her ſelf, of her Lights, Sentiments and Devotions. She ſaw now ſhe had ſome ſecret relyance on ſomething beſides God, which ſhe did not perceive till this ſtate of privation.</p>
                  <p>What thus paſſed in me were the effects of a Natural Malady, which nevertheleſs brought me to nothing, and much humbled me. For I was in ſo great a forgetfulneſs of God, that you may be aſtoniſh'd at it; and I would have hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:57606:190"/> believ'd, that a Soul having received ſo many ſenſible teſtimonies of the Love of God, could ever have ſo long a privation of actual Love, by reaſon of her former negligence and Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                  <p>What vaſt difference is there between my former and this Sickneſs? In that my Soul was all inflamed with Divine Love, luminous, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, far above any diſturbance from the Body. In this ſhe was cold and dark, yea darkneſs it ſelf, feeble, infirm, depreſs'd and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden'd with mortal fleſh.</p>
                  <p>We diſcover our Nothing and Frailties in Prayer, but the Lights and Guſts that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive therein hinder us from being ſenſible of them; what makes us feel them to the quick, muſt be ſome extraordinary affliction. It ſeem'd to me that nothing was then prevalent in me but Sentiments of Impatience, and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Peeviſhneſs; but by the Grace of God I did not always conſent to them, though they often moleſted me.</p>
                  <p>I was ſomewhat encouraged by the Relation of the Happy Death of two Fathers of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, who ended their days in the exerciſes of Charity, after they had aſſiſted the Souldiers many years, attending them in their Maladies and dolorous Neceſſities, to help them to live well, and die Happily. At laſt they died of the Plague; and deſiring paſſionately to ſuffer, one of them gave great Stroaks with his Fiſt upon his Soar, to endure ſomething more for Jeſu Chriſt, whom they both lov'd with moſt ardent Affections. 'Tis ſaid our Bleſſed Saviour
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:57606:190"/> appear'd to them at the point of Death, to Crown them and make them Happy with his Preſence; after which they died Smiling, full of Joy and Conſolations.</p>
                  <p>This did much comfort me, extremely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing at their Happineſs; in that they died in the Service of the Hoſpital for Souldiers, after they had continually endanger'd their Lives, by expoſing them to the Mouths of Musquets and Canons, and a thouſand Incommodities of Soul and Body, by the cares and ſolicitudes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on them. O how glorious was their Death? O the amiable Sufferings that brought them to it? What are my little Sufferings in compariſon of theſe? What a ſhame is it for me to feel ſo much repugnance to endure them?</p>
                  <p>Alas! I conſider that there's not a day in the year, wherein the Church does not make par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Commemoration of many Martyrs, who have had the zeal and courage to give up their Lives for Jeſus Chriſt, who died for them, that they might Honour his Sufferings by the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they endured for his ſake. Some have been expos'd to be devour'd by Beaſts, others broke upon the Wheel, others burned Alive, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers nailed to <hi>Croſſes,</hi> and all have been Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, by embracing with joy and cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the cruelleſt of Deaths that moſt barbarous Tyrants could invent to make them miſerable.</p>
                  <p>O good Jeſus, I ſee all theſe go by the way of the <hi>Croſs</hi> to come to the Perfection of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love; and I ſtay behind as one abandon'd and unworthy to ſuffer for you. What can I then do, O bleſſed Saviour? For you have ſaid,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:57606:191"/> 
                     <hi>That he who will not take up his Croſs, to follow you, is not worthy to be your Diſciple.</hi> O Love, Crucifie me, Burn me, Martyr me, <hi>Si non per Martyrium carnis, ſaltem per incendium cordis, If not by Sacrificing my Body, yet by Sacrificing my Heart.</hi> And let my affectionate deſire to ſuffer, make my Life and Martyrdom end both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>The Interiour</hi> Croſſes <hi>of the Soul in Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe Soul in the ſtate of obſcurity hardly knows her ſelf, ſhe is ſo chang'd from what ſhe was. For in the ſtate of enjoyment, the Inferiour part of the Soul with all her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance to Sufferings is quite loſt in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Delights; ſo that the Soul feels no pain at all, nothing hinders her repoſe, ſhe taſts no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſweetneſs, and has no Sentiments un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of Peace and Tranquility. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in the ſtate of Interiour Suffering, the ſupreme part of the Soul is as it were abſorp'd in the repugnances and diſguſts of Nature: Her lights are ſo ſurrounded with Darkneſs, that ſhe is left in obſcurity, and all her joy is taken from her.</p>
                  <p>Although ſhe may be very well reſigned, ſhe imagines ſhe is not; for her Intellectual confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is clouded from her: But ſhe has always before her eyes the revolts of Nature, and the
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:57606:191"/> contradictions ſhe finds to Gods good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and in a manner believing ſhe has no intellectual Reſignation, ſhe becomes doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of her condition; whereby ſhe is much ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified and plung'd in a Sea of bitterneſs:</p>
                  <p>A Soul in this ſtate of Miſeries is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, but ſhe not knowing it, remains full of Doubts and Sadneſs. Yet if you ask this Soul, if ſhe be reſigned to the will of God, ſhe will readily reply; Yes, and that ſhe had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dye than not will what pleaſes God. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this act of Reſignation does not free her from her Fears, becauſe ſhe wills this in a manner without knowing it is her Will. Our Bleſſed Saviour, by an admirable deſign of Providence, to purify this Soul the more by her Sufferings, hinders her reflection on this act of Conformity and Reſignation; ſo that ſhe receives no Comfort by this Conformity, being in the dark, and yet is not altogether left in deſolation. But in this ſtate ſhe is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, though ſhe be much diſpleaſed with her ſelf.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems to me that a Soul in this ſtate of Obſcurity is more faithful to God, than in abundance of Illuminations. To be thus in the midſt of thick Darkneſs, and believe the Perfections of the Divinity, and the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our holy Faith, as firmly as if they were clear'd up unto us by the greateſt Lights and Illuſtrations, do teſtify an extraordinary Fidelity in the Soul to God, and an annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Judgment, and a high eſteem of Gods Veracity. What wonder is it to ſee
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:57606:192"/> God and his Grandeurs in abundance of Light? But to do this when the Soul is in Darkneſs, this is admirable. Happy are thoſe Souls whom God conducts in this way, let them not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of their Privations, ſeeing this is to the end they may more glorify God, and beſt te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify their Fidelity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>O my Soul, let us be in an indifferency for any Condition, for a ſtate of Light or Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>Benedicite lux &amp; tenebrae Domino.</hi> And if Divine Providence tryes us with Obſcurity, let us be comforted, and believe that God deals well with us, eſteeming this privation as a favour from heaven.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs it is a difficult matter to be as well ſatisfied in Darkneſs, as in the Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of Paradice. But if we make ſerious reflection, that the Perfection of Chriſtianity conſiſts in a life of Privation and Poverty of Spirit, it will be no matter of Admiration. Behold S. <hi>John;</hi> lives he not in a Deſert, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of all things! his Delights are Auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Hunger, Poverty, to be unknown to the world, and to loſe his Life by the hand of the Hang-man. And which is more, he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of the Converſation of Jeſus Chriſt:</p>
                  <p>One of the greateſt <hi>interiour croſſes</hi> is to loſe the ſight of our Eyes: nevertheleſs there's ſomething in this Croſs that makes it lovely, in that it puts us in a more abſolute depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on God. I have a devotion to be in the Spiritual Life, what a blind man is in the Corporal. He goes and comes, he talks to his friends, he does his little affairs, he eats
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:57606:192"/> and drinks; and all this without ſeeing his way, or his friends, or the rooms, or Heaven, or Earth; only he gives himſelf up to the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of his Conductor. 'Tis true to do all theſe actions of our civil life in this ſort is not ſo pleaſing, but they are as really done as in the Light.</p>
                  <p>So a Soul that is without light, does the actions of a Spiritual Life, not ſo pleaſantly indeed, but yet truly and perfectly; ſeeing ſhe performs them in the annihilation of her lights and proper ſatisfaction. It ſeems to me that a Soul ought not to complain ſo much of the Lingrings of this our Pilgrimage, where we live in the obſcurity of Faith; and not ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire the diſſolution of this mortal body, under pretence to ſee clearly, and be united perfectly to the King of Glory. For really I fear theſe complaints are not ſo innocent as we imaging; ſeeing they may proceed from a diſguſt of Sufferings in a ſtate of Privation; and ſo we are more concerned for our own ſatisfaction, than content with the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>Of the heavineſs of interiour</hi> Croſſes.</head>
                  <p>GOD ſometimes treats a Soul in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as a Reprobate, baniſhing her from his preſence, and depriving her of all enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for more or leſs time, as he thinks good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> During this ſtate to preſerve a perfect Reſignation to Gods will, is to practiſe pure virtue, and thoſe ſouls muſt be very faithful that are capable thereof.</p>
                  <p>The Soul in enjoyments, is, as if ſhe was glorified; ſhe feels no trouble, her Paſſions neither diſturb her Peace, nor darken her Lights, ſhe is full of contentment delighting in God; the Creatures do not divert her from the Creator; And if at any time they ſeem to ſtop her courſe, ſhe preſently doubles her paces to haſten after her Well-beloved, being a tracted with the odours of his Perfumes.</p>
                  <p>But in the ſtate of Interiour Suffering, the Soul becomes a Captive loaden with Irons, buffeted with Temptations, diſturb'd with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Paſſions, loſt in extravagant Thoughts, ſo that ſhe cannot draw near to God, but like a poor Criminal lying in a dark dungeon, is left to her ſelf without any ſenſible Relief. This is her ſad conditition in this miſerable Captivity, without either Divine or Humane Conſolations, the influences of Heavenbeing withheld from her, and the refreſhments of
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:57606:193"/> Earth deny'd her, crucified between them both without help from either.</p>
                  <p>In this ſtate the Soul is in continual fears of offending God, and falling from her Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Exerciſes: that ſhe ſeeks Comforts from Creatures, and is ſo injurious to her Divine Center, from whom only ſhe ought to receive Repoſe and Contentment. However ſhe may much honour God by theſe interiour Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, if ſhe thereby does homage to the dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liction of the Son of God, in his Torments on the <hi>Croſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The eminency of a ſupernatural Life finds matter of Practice in all ſorts of Sufferings, interiour or exteriour; but methinks the Soul can never be ſo compleat a Sacrifice as on the Altar of <hi>interiour Croſſes;</hi> whether they come from the immediate hand of God, from others, or our ſelves: It matters not much who makes the <hi>Croſs</hi> on which we ſuffer, be they friends or enemies, God or our ſelves; if we do but ſuffer 'tis ſufficient; and we ought to be joyful, or at leaſt content to ſee our ſelves crucified ſome way or other. And as long as we live Exiles here, we ſhall hardly be without ſome <hi>Croſſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Soul that hath once taſted the ſweetneſs of God, finds it a <hi>croſs</hi> to be taken up too much with worldly buſineſs; yea even to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy neceſſities becomes troubleſome to her. She finds a <hi>croſs</hi> when ſhe is put to appeaſe the ſedition of her Paſſions, when ſhe perceives the eyes of Contemplation darkned by her Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, when ſhe is over-burden'd with the
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:57606:194"/> weight of her mortal body tending to corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption: all theſe miſeries are <hi>croſſes</hi> to her, hindring her enjoyments of God. But a ſaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soul to accompliſh the will of God, does bear them couragiouſly.</p>
                  <p>It much concerns us to deſire of God a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Light and Grace, to ſee the beauty of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> that we may love to ſuffer. We complain of the miſeries of this life, and the rigours of our baniſhment, becauſe we diſcern not that ſecret virtue which Privations and Croſſes have to unite us to God. It is great and powerful, though little known, and leſs ſought after, by reaſon it is not ſo ſweet and pleaſant as that force which ceaſes our Spirits in the Lights of enjoyment: But it ſuffices me, my God, that I am united to you, I deſire not the pleaſing Sentiments of Union, becauſe Purity there is not ſo eminent.</p>
                  <p>The Mercy of God does triumph in the ſtate of Light and Sweetneſs, and this is the time to glorifie his Goodneſs The Juſtice of God appears more viſible in the ſtate of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity and Sufferings, and this is the time to magnify his Greatneſs. And what content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is it to a Soul to know, that let her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be what it will, the Divine Perfections may be glorified by her!</p>
                  <p>When God in a manner leaves us to our ſelves, our weakneſs appears ſo great, that the leaſt ſtroke of Adverſity quite caſts us down: at other times when we are ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Almighty, an Army in battle aray can never daunt us. Let us follow the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:57606:194"/> of Grace, when ſhe invites us to reflect on ſuch like dispoſitions; for the Soul will thereby know her extreme dependance upon God, and her own infinite frailty, her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in God will be re-doubled, and her dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in her ſelf will be augmented; and ſhe will know by experience, that God mortifies and quickens when he pleaſes, and that he is our only Supporter.</p>
                  <p>To be then in continual union with God, the Soul muſt neceſſarily have a perfect indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency to every ſtate, and a reſolute will to be wholly for God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Illuſtrations indeed make the Soul more attentive, but not more united: for a loving Soul in Sufferings adheres to God more cloſely than in the greateſt Lights of Prayer. Let us not then meaſure the Union by Enjoyment but by Suffering; for the more the Soul ſuffers for God, the more intimately is ſhe united to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is one of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of the Supernatural Life, and the only thing that can prevail with us to make <hi>Croſſes,</hi> the heavier they are, to be the more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable.</p>
                  <p>I know a Soul that ſuffers extraordinary pains of all ſorts, but 'tis with aridity of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; ſeeing only the Will of God therein, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcovering the Beauty of Sufferings, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs when they have left her, God being not willing ſhe ſhould receive Conſolations from ſuch a ſight, which might much diminiſh the Purity of her Love.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. X. <hi>The great Fruit we may reap from Interiour</hi> Croſſes.</head>
                  <p>I Thought that on this day of particular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, I ſhould have been all on a flame with Divine Love: But I have been in a manner al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways diſtracted in my Prayers, though I had my Book in my hand, my Spirit not being in a temper for Interiour Exerciſes. To ſpeak Truth, I found my ſelf much chang'd, it pleaſing God, that having not correſponded to my ſtate of Light and ſweetneſs, his Juſtice ſhould put me into this rigour and obſcurity, and bleſſed be his Name for evermore.</p>
                  <p>What augments my ſorrow, is, that I have not been Faithful to many opportunities of practiſing great Virtues. At other times I have found all things helping me towards God, now every thing diverts me, inſomuch that the fire of Love is in a manner wholly extinguiſhed with the waves of Temptations. Methinks I find my ſelf in an abandonment ſo great, as if I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enjoyed conſolations.</p>
                  <p>Being to begin any good work, I feel a tepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and repugnance to it. The very thoughts of Poverty did horribly afright me: To be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, to want accomodations, to ſuffer pains, was terrible unto me. It increas'd this bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in that the Servants of God did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me as formerly; ſo that it muſt go very ill with me, if ſome powerful hand come not into
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:57606:195"/> my ſuccour. And what makes my condition more deplorable, is that I am ſo ſenſible of the privation of earthly things: For if it was the want of Gods preſence and his Graces that did afflict me, that methinks would afford ſome conſolation. I now in a manner make no Prayer, that is, my Prayer is as good as nothing: I am full of Diſtractions when I Communicate: I am apt to fall into paſſion on every occaſion; the leaſt thing does much trouble me. This day I had ſome good Intervals, during which I was taken up with theſe thoughts.</p>
                  <p>What is man, O my God, when you ceaſe to viſit him? How great is his Poverty, his Wants, and his Miſeries? I ſhould never have believ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d it, if I had not known it by experience in this ſmall time that you have left me to my ſelf. O my Soul, how great is thy weakneſs? How profound is thy own nothing, and almoſt incredible? Lay it up well now in thy memory, and never forget it.</p>
                  <p>What can I do, O my God, without you? My Spirit is nothing but a dark Dungeon, and my heart is a recepticle of all ſorts of evil Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents and extravagant Thoughts: No incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to good, but ſtrong efforts to that which is evil. Alas! 'tis now I find by experience the abſolute dependance I have upon you, more than a ſhaddow on the Body, or the Light on the <hi>Sun,</hi> I was never ſo annihilated and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in my own nothing as now. I can ſee no ſtability either in my ſelf or any Creature. The whole World cannot uphold him, whom you have forſaken. O how vain is the conſolation
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:57606:196"/> of Creatures, when that of the Creator fails us?</p>
                  <p>Dare I hereafter think my ſelf worthy of the leaſt Sentiments of Grace, that have had the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of my exceſſive miſeries? Verily, if God ſhould plunge me into Hell, I ſhould not be aſtoniſh'd at it; but rather admire his Mercies for bearing ſo long with ſo ungrateful a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Neither am I at all amazed at my fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for what wonder is it to ſee frailty it ſelf frail? What moſt humbles me, is to feel in my ſelf ſo great repugnance to ſuffer ſo little. What would become of me, if I ſhould be charged to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Interiour and Exteriour Sufferings? O how far am I from the Patience of Saints, and the Love that they have for the greateſt <hi>Croſſes?</hi> Humble thy ſelf, O my Soul, humble thy ſelf to the very center of thy own nothing.</p>
                  <p>Bleſſed is the man who always fears. God leaves us on purpoſe in this World without a certainty of our Salvation, ſo that no perſon knowes whether he be worthy of Love or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred. This uncertainty is a great <hi>Croſs,</hi> and God to try us by Sufferings, permits us now and then to fall into perplexing doubts concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our Interiour ſtate and diſpoſitions; to which our Spiritual Guides are as lyable as our ſelves, and therefore cannot give us any Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible aſſurance? 'Tis no ordinary perplexity to travel in a difficult way, without aſſurance whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be right or wrong, to come to our journey's end. To doubt whether we be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the ſhadows of our ignorance, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than conducted by the Light of Grace, is
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:57606:196"/> one of the heavieſt <hi>Croſſes</hi> of a Spiritual Life: But 'tis alſo moſt conducing to purifie the Soul, and make her die to her own Intereſt and Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; that in the midſt of all her troubles ſhe may caſt her ſelf wholly upon God, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely abandon her ſelf to his Protection.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>COnferring about Patience with ſome Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, we concluded that a Soul ought not only apply her ſelf to bear with the Imperfections of others, but more eſpecially her own. For after our failings, we muſt not with an impetuous Sollicitude ſearch after the means to Cure an Evil, that oftentimes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſes us rather for our own Intereſt, than the Intereſt of God. Nor is it prudential, while we are in a heat, to reſolve ſuddenly to make ſo many Examens, Meditations, and undergo ſo many Auſterities; but principally we muſt have an eye to God and his Glory, and make an act of Contrition, to repair the injury we have done him by our fault: And then practice Patience, whereby we ſhall bear with Peace and Tranquility the ſight of our Miſery, which too often makes us ſad and anxious. But this proceeds from want of Love for Abjection; for whoſoever can be content to be abject, ſhall never be diſquieted, but will enjoy a profound
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:57606:197"/> Peace in the greateſt Humiliations. <hi>Diſcite à me quia mitis ſum &amp; humilis corde, &amp; invenietis requiem animabus veſtris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We muſt not then ſpend our time unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably after our failings, as we too often do: But continuing in Peace of mind, and being hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for our defects, we ſhall be better diſpoſed to return to union with God, where is the practice of Virtue, without being too much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. In this ſtate let us ſay with a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in Gods Mercies, <hi>Cor Contritum &amp; Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliatum, Deus non deſpicies; A Contrite and Humble Heart, O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe.</hi> For he that is contrite becauſe he has offended his Heavenly Father, and truly humbled for his Unworthineſs, cannot but be Gracious in Gods fight.</p>
                  <p>This well underſtood, and faithfully practis'd, leaves the Soul in great Peace, makes her Humble and Patient to bear all defects with meekneſs and compaſſion. But becauſe we are more ſenſible of our own Failings, than thoſe of others, we have need of more Patience on our own behalf.</p>
                  <p>'Tis an effect of pure Love to make the Soul diſpleas'd with our Imperfections and Failings, without being diſquieted at the Humiliation and Confuſion that attend them. We ought indeed to afflict our ſelves for offending God, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce that we are aſham'd we have offended him; for this plucks down our Pride, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs the injury done to the Divine Majeſty. But if we refuſe to acknowledge our Failings, we are ſo much the more miſerable, in that we will not confeſs our miſery.</p>
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:57606:197"/>
                  <p> Patience and Longanimity are very neceſſary for us to go fairly on in the ways of God. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Perfection is not the work of a day; we muſt bear with our Frailties and Imperfections many years. 'Tis a groſs miſtake ariſing from Self-love, to think to march more ſpeedily in ways of Grace than That enables us to perform. From hence it proceeds that we are leſs taken up with the thoughts of God, than of our ſelves and our own condition. We are full of afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apprehenſions that what we do in Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is nothing worth that the beſt things are bad as we uſe them, Imperfection and Miſery being our conſtant attendants. But this perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual looking downward on our ſelves is preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to our advancement in Perfection; when we ſhould principally look up to God, and ſuch as we are caſt our ſelves into the Arms of Jeſus Chriſt, having an eye to him, and relying upon him.</p>
                  <p>When we are reſolv'd to take up our thoughts with God, and put our confidence in him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much ruminating on our own Failings, this will not bury them in oblivion, but God will diſcover them to us in a way incomparably better, than what we can know by our own endeavours; for all we can do is nothing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of thoſe helps we ſhall find in him, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance us in Perfection.</p>
                  <p>What gain we by thus perpetually picking quarrels with our own ſelves? After all, we ſhall never be without Imperfection. What can we diſcover in the ground of our Hearts, but that Thornes and Briers do grow there daily,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:57606:198"/> with a thouſand Failings, uſe what diligence we can to manure and cultivate it? As long as we bottom upon our ſelves, we languiſh continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Imperfections. Let us free our ſelves from our ſelves as ſoon as we can; when we have once learn'd to be more careful to pleaſe God then our ſelves, we ſhall go on much pleaſanter in the ways of God, and arrive ſooner at the region of Peace and Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                  <p>'Tis the true courſe of a Super-natural Life to give our ſelves up to the conduct of Grace; which ſometimes puts us to combat with our Paſſions; at other times tryes us with Interiour and Exteriour Sufferings; ſometimes leaves us to diſcurſive Prayer, and then again elevates the Soul on the wings of Contemplation, refreſhing her with variety of Spiritual Dainties: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times makes all things eaſie to us without tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel or difficulty; and ſometimes to feel a kind of tedious wearineſs in the ways of God. But in all this the Soul that is abandon'd to the good pleaſure of God, keeps her ſelf Peaceable and contented, and indifferent to whatſoever God ſhall determine of her.</p>
                  <p>For my part, I too often feel the repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of my depraved Nature, but then I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make this a matter of Humiliation. 'Tis a great Miſery to be always Imperfect, and not to be able to cure our Spiritual Maladies: But we muſt as well practice Patience in theſe, as in Corporal Infirmities. I have a mind to call my Hermitage the <hi>Hoſpital of the Incurable,</hi> and only to lodge with me ſuch poor Spiritual Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:57606:198"/> who have a good will to heal their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, but yet ſtill fall into relapſes. At <hi>Paris</hi> there's an <hi>Hoſpital</hi> for thoſe who are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable in Body; But mine ſhall be for ſuch in Soul.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. I. <hi>What Eſteem we ought to have for</hi> Prayer.</head>
                  <p>WE muſt have a great care not to place Perfection where it is not, for this will much retard us in the path of Virtue. We muſt not therefore have too great an eſteem for the Unitive Myſtick way; not but that it is good, and very good for a Soul that God conducts to Perfection by ſuch extraordinary Elevations: But we may ſafely believe the Unitive Practical way to be as excellent and more neceſſary, ſeeing 'tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the practice of a Chriſtian Life; and the other conſiſts in Elevations and Unions of Spirit with God by Contemplation.</p>
                  <p>'Tis obſervable that our Bleſſed Saviour ſays, <hi>Whoſoever will come after me, muſt take up his</hi>
                     <pb n="378" facs="tcp:57606:200"/> Croſs, <hi>and follow me.</hi> He ſays not, he muſt be Elevated in Prayer, <hi>but he muſt take up his</hi> Croſs; that is, he muſt practice the Maxims of the Goſpel. Happy then are thoſe who ſuffer, although they be not elevated in Spirit. And thoſe who are elevated in Spirit, are not happy, but inaſmuch as they are conform to Jeſus Chriſt Crucified, and by ſuch Unions are more diſpoſed to the <hi>Croſs</hi> and Sufferings. The Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Life is in a manner the end of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Life, whoſe Guſts and Lights conduce to fortifie the Soul, to carry her <hi>Croſs</hi> the better.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Tereſa</hi> ſays, <hi>That 'tis a good ſign after a Soul has been in an extaſie, if ſhe find in her ſelf extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary deſires to ſuffer, in that ſhe cannot return from thoſe Holy Communications with God but well inſtructed.</hi> For the Perfection of Love here conſiſts in Suffering for the Love of Jeſus, and not enjoying him. Let us not complain then, if we be not elevated by Myſtick Unions, but rather rejoyce too ſee our poor Soul in Prayer among the Thorns of dryneſs and aridities, than the Roſes of a ſweet and guſtful Devotion. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour as well as Exteriour Sufferings muſt be pleaſing to us, ſeeing a true Chriſtian ought to Glory in nothing but the <hi>Croſs</hi> of Chriſt. But that did extend it ſelf as well to his Soul as Body; for his Divine Soul was deprived of ſenſible ſuccours in this Dereliction on the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and we muſt Love to be conform to him, and reſt content. Happy are thoſe Souls that love Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings rather than Enjoyments; and complain of nothing ſooner than not to ſuffer.</p>
                  <pb n="379" facs="tcp:57606:200"/>
                  <p> A Soul which receives no great Light from God in Prayer, but is left in darkneſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour Sufferings, carries in reality a heavy <hi>Croſs:</hi> But a Soul illuminated in Prayer by illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations from Heaven, endures another <hi>Croſs</hi> more intime and burdenſom. For this Light diſcovering to her the great merit of pure Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, 'tis a pain to her not to ſuffer; and ſo ſhe remains without all ſort of conſolation; ſeeing the ſtate of Light and Sweetneſs appear to her not preferrable to that of obſcurity: And ſo taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe Sweets, they are not now ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, having diſcover'd that the bitterneſs of Aridities is more acceptable to a Soul, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires nothing but the pure Love of Jeſus Chriſt Crucified, and that thereby may be more firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united to her Saviour.</p>
                  <p>When I am in Darkneſs and Aridities, I ſtand in need of an indifferency in every ſtate, that I may bear with Patience my Abjection and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty. I have more need of Indifferency when my Soul is enlightned; which irradiations God vouchſafes us to ſtrengthen our weakneſs, and not, as I have thought heretofore, to advance us in the practice of Divine Love, which is more eminent in the contrary condition. I have ſtood in need of comfort in my Sufferings; and I have ſtood more in need of it in a ſtate of Joy and Sweetneſs. I ſaid heretofore when I abounded with Conſolations, that I ſhould never ſuffer again: At preſent I think I ſhall ſuffer as long as I live, ſeeing I find <hi>Croſſes</hi> in every ſtate; and I frame my ſelf to an Indifferency to Gods will and Pleaſure in his dealings with me. Hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:57606:201"/> inebriated with Conſolations, I ſaid, <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite me floribus, ſtipate me malis quia amore lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueo, Surround me with Flowers and Aples to augment my Comforts, and increaſe my Love:</hi> But now I ſay, ſurround me with <hi>Croſses,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts and Sufferings, for languiſhing with Love, I deſire to Love Jeſus better than ever.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a wonderful thing that I ſhould be more poor now, then when I was deprived of all Conſolation. I will not then too greedily ſeek after Light and Sweetneſs, ſeeing methinks they make me poorer. I ſtand amaz'd to ſee a Soul to find her ſelf deſolate by Conſolation. In De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations the Inferiour part of the Soul ſuffers, but in Conſolations the Superiour part, and more elevated, but little known. I perceive that the Supreme part of the Soul cannot be content and comforted but by the Death of the ſenſual part, and a ſeperation from all inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Affections to the Creature: I ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rather deſire a ſtate of Deſolation, and Fidelity therein, than all the Delicious guſts of Prayer, though ſo elevated, as to bring the Soul to raviſhing extaſies.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of the different ſorts of Mental Prayer.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>I Find a compariſon which explicates very well the difference of ordinary Prayer and Prayer Paſſive. A man may ſee well enough the Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a chamber, and the riches of a Cabinet,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:57606:201"/> by ſtriking Fire and lighting a Candle, to view the particulars: Or by the lighting of the <hi>Sun,</hi> when we have nothing to do, but to open our eyes to behold thoſe Objects. Meditation much reſembles the firſt way of ſeeing with a Candle: Perfect Contemplation the ſecond way of ſeeing by the <hi>Sun;</hi> becauſe 'tis done not only without labour, but all at once, and with delight. When the Light of the <hi>Sun</hi> fails us, we muſt ſupply it with a Lamp or Candle: When God does not Communicate himſelf by Contemplation, we muſt ſeek after him by Meditation, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with Gods Gifts, whatever they be, with Peace and Humility.</p>
                  <p>When God withdraws his Paſſive Light, 'tis in vain to ſtrive to retain it: We muſt acquieſs in his Pleaſure 'till it return again as he thinks good. If God pleaſe to leave us in darkneſs, without <hi>Sun</hi> or Candle, 'tis an opportunity to practice Humility and Patience; for we muſt deſire nothing but God alone, and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he thinks beſt. Let a Soul be never ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſhe is never continually elevated to a high degree of Contemplation, but more or leſs as it pleaſes God, ſhe muſt deſcend to the practice of Virtue, and exerciſes of Charity, or to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſive Meditation, by Applications to God in the obſcurity of Faith. She muſt therefore keep her ſelf in an Indifferency, riſing and falling ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the conduct of Gods Holy Spirit: Always eſteeming her ſelf unworthy of the leaſt Grace, and never pretend by forcing her Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to the extraordinary favours of high Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation. But when ſhe has a call to ſuch
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:57606:202"/> elevations in Prayer, the way to arrive thither is by a perfect death to all things, and a Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful imitation of Jeſus Chriſt in his Crucified ſtates of Abjection and Poverty, with a Love of Solitude, as much as our condition will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit:</p>
                  <p>There's a great deal of difference between that Light and Fervour which is imparted to a Soul in the elevations of paſſive Prayer, and that Light which is procured by the ordinary Grace of Meditation. That is more in time and piercing, and full of Heavenly Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: This however ſuffices to acquire Virtues, and ſerve God in the ſtate of our Vocation. 'Tis our duty to attend to our preſent condition with Peace and Humility, and ſubmiſſion to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will, and let God alone to order, as he pleaſes the time of his Viſits, and our manner of Prayer. Sometimes this will be by ſimple Thoughts, ſometimes by Diſcourſe, ſometimes by Faith alone, and ſometimes by paſſive Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations. But whatever is given us, we muſt receive from the hand of the Divine Goodneſs with great reſpect and Thankfulneſs, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging our ſelves unworthy of the leaſt good Thought.</p>
                  <p>That which a Soul ought to do both in, and out of Prayer, is to be very attentive to Gods Holy Inſpirations, and follow them, with Courage and Fidelity. If ſhe find that God ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates her to extraordinary Contemplation, let her yield to thoſe Divine impreſſions: If ſhe be kept in an ordinary way, let her there abide: If ſhe be left in Aridities, let her alſo ſit down
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:57606:202"/> without complaining. The great ſecret of a Spiritual Life, is for a Soul to purifie her ſelf, ſo as to comply with the motions of God, who is our <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> our Origen and final end.</p>
                  <p>There are things ſufficiently declared, as the Commandments of God and the Church, the Duties we owe to Obedience, Charity, or Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. There's no need to expect immediate Light from God for the performance of theſe things: But only in ſuch which are neither commanded, nor forbidden: And in theſe great Purity of Soul is neceſſary to diſcern the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Grace, for fear we be deceiv'd by our own imaginations.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Saints who by the Impulſes of Gods Holy Spirit have writ Spiritual Treatiſes, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Interiour Chriſtians in the wayes of God, oftentimes affect us with their Thoughts and Sentiments, becauſe they Pray in Heaven for this Bleſſing on their labours on Earth; and therefore tis Beneficial to read their Books to advance our Devotion. But do what we can, we ſhall never know what that Prayer is by what thoſe Books write of it, unleſs by the practice and Light of the ſame Prayer.</p>
                  <p>We know well enough in general, that Prayer is the ſource of all Virtue in the Soul; who leaves that off, falls into Luke-warmneſs, and Imperfections. Prayer is a Holy Fire that warms the Heart and Affections, which without it muſt of neceſſity grow cold in Devotion. In Health or Sickneſs, Joy or Sorrow, we muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Pray, except we have a mind to fall from Grace to our utter ruin.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. <hi>That we ought to be indifferent to what manner of</hi> Prayer <hi>God is pleaſed to give us.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>WE ought to ſhun two Extreams equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vitious. The one is to covet more Grace and Perfection than God intends us, ſo as to be troubled and diſguſted to ſee others more elevated in Gifts of <hi>Prayer</hi> than our ſelves: The other is not to co-operate faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Grace vouchſaf'd us, either for want of Courage in the Difficulties that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in the practice of Virtue; or of Attention to obſerve the Motions of Grace, or being obſerved, by too eaſily diverting our ſelves to other matters, and ſo neglecting the Mercies of God.</p>
                  <p>When a Soul is well purified, and hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the Impulſes of Grace in her, and can diſtinguiſh them from the motions of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhe muſt give free ingreſs to the rayes of this Light from Heaven, that ſhe may be throughly illuminated and warm'd in her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions. For to do otherwiſe under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Humility and fear of deception, is not to yield to the Conduct of God's Spirit, who inſpires when, and whom he pleaſes. 'Tis then our Duty to be entirely paſſive, that God may fully work his Will in us.</p>
                  <pb n="385" facs="tcp:57606:203"/>
                  <p> When theſe Divine Illuminations are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from a Soul, for the Glory of God, and her good, and ſo left in darkneſs: or when her own Imperfections have made her not ſo capable of ſupernatural Lights: ſhe muſt reſt contented with theſe privations, till it pleaſes the Sun of Righteouſneſs to ſhine upon her. A purified Soul is ſatisfied and reſign'd on ſuch occaſions, becauſe God only is her joy, and not his gifts, which he by his infinite Goodneſs communicates to her when he pleaſes. And this is the reaſon that ſhe loves not her inward peace and joy, when ſhe is deprived of heavenly Irradiations and Gifts in Prayer.</p>
                  <p>He who gives himſelf up to his Prince for his ſole intereſt and ſatisfaction, without ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own peculiar concerns and contentment, does not much matter what Service he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and what Rewards he receives, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Prince be well pleaſed and ſatisfied. If he keep him near his perſon, to careſs him, he is content: not that he is careſſed, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is his Princes pleaſure. If he imploy him afar off in troubleſome Affairs, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; not to be ſo far from his Perſon, and in a hazardous Employment, but becauſe this is the Pleaſure of his Prince, whoſe Content he only had an eye to, in giving himſelf up unto his Service. This is the true caſe of a Soul that deſires to ſerve God purely for the Love of God. If God careſs her in <hi>Prayer</hi> with Viſits full of Sweetneſs, ſhe is content, becauſe this is his Pleaſure; if he affords not
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:57606:204"/> his Preſence but leaves her in Darkneſs, ſhe is content, becauſe 'tis the good pleaſure of God. If God call her to the exerciſes of Charity in a life more active and laborious than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative, ſhe is content becauſe this is the good pleaſure of God, which is the only thing ſhe ſeeks and deſires in his Service.</p>
                  <p>This indifferency diſpoſes a Soul to receive great Graces; for by this means ſhe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times arrives to a total oblivion of her ſelf and all creatures, without any reflection on her own Intereſts, Temporal or Eternal, have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing in her eye but the good pleaſure of God, and deſiring him alone: inſomuch that if any thing of ſelf creep in at any time, as ſoon as ſhe diſcovers it, 'tis diſtaſteful to her. This is a ſtate of great Nakedneſs, and entire Mortification, and a perfect diſpoſition to moſt ſublime Prayer; whether God elevates a Soul, whom he ſees ready to ſubmit to the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Prayer,</hi> or Dereliction, if ſo he pleaſes.</p>
                  <p>It happens oftentimes that in a ſtate of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, a Soul is ſo ſurrounded with darkneſs, that ſhe ſees nothing of God, who ſeems en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to be hid from her: and that which aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments this <hi>Croſs,</hi> ſhe is ſo wholly taken up with her Loſs, that ſhe thinks not of the means to recover her happineſs.</p>
                  <p>If in this ſtate a Soul be content with this rigorous uſage, with all humble ſubmiſſion to the good pleaſure of God, though ſhe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends it not at preſent, ſhe is united to God in a tranſcendent manner, and poſſeſſes her ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign-Good, when ſhe fears ſhe has loſt him.
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:57606:204"/> This is the preheminence of a Soul, which is not wedded to one manner of <hi>Prayer</hi> more than another, but holds her ſelf in an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency to receive of God whatever he pleaſes. And let her <hi>Prayer</hi> be what it will, ſhe will be ſure not to perform the Work of God negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently.</p>

                  <p>VVE muſt underſtand aright, that all our Perfection, and all the Glory we can bring to God, lyes in our Interiour and not ſo much in our Exteriour Actions. Alas! we paſs away our time vainly and unprofitably, both to God and our ſelves. There's nothing ſo precious as his Interiour, nothing is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before it, ſeeing thereby God is moſt glorified. And therefore of all our Sacrifices the Heart is the principal, and none of our Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings are acceptable without it. <hi>Fili mi, da mihi cor tuum.</hi> 'Tis from the Interiour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the pure Love of God, and of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, the Purity of Intention, the Zeal of the Glory of God, and whatever Riches the Soul poſſeſſes: And yet we too often neglect this, to make a fair outward ſhow in exteriour acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are ordinarily ſullied with impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by a mixture with the Intereſts of corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted Nature.</p>
                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:57606:205"/>
                  <p> Too many paſs away the greateſt part of their Life in Impurity and Imperfections for want of Light: and they want Light, becauſe it is not ordinarily obtained but by <hi>Prayer:</hi> and they neglect <hi>Prayer</hi> under ſpecious preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of gaining time, to do good to others, and advance the glory of God; and ſo want this Light, and thereupon fail in their correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Grace of God. A Soul muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to her Times of <hi>Prayer,</hi> if ſhe intend to nouriſh the Life of Grace in her, and not to pray only then, when ſhe has nothing elſe to do that is good and commendable: which is but an artifice of Satan, by other Exerciſes of Charity to withdraw well-meaning Souls from <hi>Prayer;</hi> and this we muſt have a gseat care of, being a ſubtile Temptation. If hereby he can weaken the vigour of the Soul, 'tis that he lookt for, and then he will ſoon induce us to fall into ſuch Defects and Imperfections, which will bring great Prejudice to a ſpiritual Life. How many Souls are there, who endanger their Ruine even by Works of Charity, either by over-doing or not doing them according to the order of God and Grace?</p>
                  <p>We muſt have a generous Fidelity to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of holy Prayer, by means whereof we approach to the Divine Source, from whence the Soul rceives all Strength and Vertue. <hi>Prayer</hi> is a holy fire to which who draws near has warm affections for God; who ſhuns it, muſt of neceſſity fall into Tepedity and Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſs. Whatever our condition be, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Sickneſs or Health, in Abjection or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:57606:205"/> in Poverty or Abundance, let us never fail of our Duty to God by <hi>Prayer,</hi> in the beſt manner we can, being the Powerful means to procure and advance our union with God, our only Happineſs. I canot poſſibly wiſh a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Good to any perſon I love, than the Gift of <hi>Prayer;</hi> knowing that thereby we enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cabinet of the Secrets of God, and are made partakers of his Graces</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prayer</hi> then is the Source of all Grace in the Soul, without which by degrees ſhe tends to ruine. No affairs whatſoever could ever hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Saints from their conſtant Devotions. Jeſus Chriſt himſelf has ſhew'd us this by his example, ſpending whole Nights in <hi>Prayer</hi> and Contemplation. Our Diſorders proceed much by too lightly engaging our ſelves, for want of Circumſpection, in humane affairs, to which we have no Call from God, and therefore are not favoured by him with Succeſs; whereby we fall into many Defects, and become too often indiſpos'd to <hi>Prayer;</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> failing us, we want all things.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Wheel that muſt ſet all a going in our Spiritual Life, is this Maxim, <hi>That our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection conſiſts principally in our Interiour.</hi> But it cannot go well with our Interiour without Fidelity to Grace, which works in us a Love of Mortification and Auſterities, an Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Solitude, and a kind of Abhorrence of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Pleaſures, and ſuch Vanity as the World admires.</p>
                  <p>Now this Grace that brings forth theſe good Fruits in us, is not obtained but by Prayer, nor
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:57606:206"/> ordinarily augmented but by Prayer, nor well known ſo as to correſpond to its motions but by Prayer. But 'tis very difficult and in a manner impoſſible to preſerve the Spirit of Prayer in the Multiplicity of Affairs, which for the moſt part are inſtrumental to divert our Thoughts from God: and ſo few Souls attain to Perfection, becauſe few diſpoſe themſelves to pure <hi>Prayer;</hi> neglecting it too much, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretence of gaining Time to do good to others.</p>
                  <p>A Soul that would be wholly for God, muſt diſcreetly ſhun the Obſtacles of Perfections, though never ſo ſpecious with Courage and Fidelity. Who is weak in <hi>Prayer,</hi> muſt not lay out himſelf too much in Action; for then he will profit little in the wayes of God, and his Interiour will not advance in Vertue.</p>
                  <p>When we ſee many great Servants of God to do glorious things, for the Love, and Service, and Honour of their great Maſter, with high Commendation; this ſometimes raiſes an emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in us to follow their Examples; but our Fidelity does not conſiſt herein, it being our Duty to make the beſt we can of the Grace we have received, and admire without envy the Gifts of others.</p>
                  <p>Methinks I have a Deſire to be but as God will have me, neither more nor leſs, either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriourly or exteriourly, in Nature or Grace. I ſee others Perfect and my ſelf Imperfect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcouragement. I behold even with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent others commanding their Paſſions, and my ſelf fighting for Victory; others doing
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:57606:206"/> much for God, and I in a manner doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; others Strong and Couragious in the Service of God, and my ſelf nothing but Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Miſery.</p>
                  <p>I am comforted in conſidering the Deſigns of God concerning me, and acquieſce in his good Pleaſure. For God refuſes us not ſometimes to take unprofitable Servants into his houſe, who only ſerve to ſet forth his Bounty and Magnificence: as we ſee with us ſome great Perſons do ſhow their Grandeurs. When we have nothing to do but only to pray, we ſeem to ſome to be but unprofitable, and do God but little or no Service; but I reſt contented herein, ſeeing God hereby does magnify his Goodneſs and Mercy to me. I doubt not but there are many Souls in Heaven, who have in the eyes of the World done little Service for God; as Solitares in the Deſerts, and many Perſons without Talents, and yet have high Places in the Manſions of Eternity. They ſpent all their Time to purify their Interiour, by being faithful to the Graces they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the infinite Bounty of God, and the Service they rendred him, to the Glory of his Name, is only written in his Omniſcience; but will be laid open to the World at the great Day of Manifeſtation.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Of the Impediments of</hi> Prayer.</head>
                  <p>I Clearly ſee and know by Experience, that the temporal Affairs of our Oeconomy does not a little take us off from God. We do ill in it; yea, it being our Obligation, 'tis plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God to manage our Temporals with a good Intention: though it would be better, if we can; to lay aſide theſe Worldly Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, to ſpend our time only in God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. And thoſe who have a Call from God, to attend on him alone, in a ſtate of Prayer and Contemplation, cannot without being unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his Grace, continue in the ſolicitous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions of worldly Affairs.</p>
                  <p>I muſt needs ſay that Worldly Buſineſs dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens and hinders my Soul in her Spiritual Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes; and I would never ſpend time therein upon Humane Conſiderations, but purely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God has ſo order'd it. However it muſt be our care not to ſpend more time therein than neceſſity requires. Too delicate Dyet; though it may ſtrengthen Nature, yet it wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens Grace. When the Body is brought down by Abſtinence, the Soul is more vigorous in her Elevations to God. I find this true in me by Experience.</p>
                  <p>A Soul muſt be very well grounded in Grace, that among temporal Imployments and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cares, can keep her ſelf up in Fervour and
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:57606:207"/> Purity. She meets with a thouſand Occaſions to move her to Anger, Impatience, Sadneſs, and vain Joy: and though ſhe do not give way to them, yet ſhe is ſenſible of them, and this muſt needs more or leſs diſturb her Interiour Peace, whereby ſhe is united to God her Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. A little thing will hinder a Soul from raiſing her ſelf to Contemplation, and a leſs matter will ſomewhat darken her when eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; becauſe the leaſt emotion of Spirit will indiſpoſe her to receive Divine Impreſſions. Therefore a man of Prayer muſt be a man dead and mortified; for that is not pure Prayer, which does not work in us a victory over our Paſſions and Vicious Inclinations, and bring us to the practice of all Chriſtian Virtues.</p>
                  <p>I ſee now more clearly than ever, that the Spirit of Prayer does not perſevere and gather ſtrength, but in thoſe who are dead to Senſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, auſtere to themſelves, Penitent, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged from whatſoever is not God. 'Tis true, as for Corporal Auſterities, a tender Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt follow the Councel of a Director: But commonly we are too indulgent to our ſelves, and far from the practice of great Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, who were very ſevere to themſelves, and alſo great Contemplatives. We deceive our ſelves if we think to enter into a ſtate of Prayer, and take delight in Worldly things. Though in rigour this may in ſome ſort be permitted to Candidates of Devotion, yet not to Profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, in whom the Spirit of Prayer and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to Jeſus Chriſt Crucified ought to be wholly predominant. For 'tis our Duty to live
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:57606:208"/> Conformably to that ſtate where God has put us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſays very well; <hi>If we refuſe Exteriour Conſolations, we ſhall receive Interiour.</hi> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hereof ſeems to me to be this, becauſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour Conſolations participate of the Purity of their ſource, which is the union of God with the Soul, and will not permit any mixture with Impurity and Imperfection. For ſenſual Joyes and Conſolations are Earthly, Impure, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and conſequently are contrary to the Spirit of Grace, which makes the Soul pure and Penitent, and Mortified to the things of this Life. Moreover, Interiour Conſolations are ſlender participations of thoſe Infinite Delights which God has in himſelf of himſelf; and he is jealous of ſuch favours, not communicating them but to a Soul entirely beloved, that takes no delight but in him alone. But when earthly conſolations enter into a Soul, they draw her partly from God, and ſo God withdraws his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours from her.</p>
                  <p>For this reaſon the Saints who would be wholly for God, mortified themſelves without reſerve, as much as humane weakneſs would permit; that no ſenſual or Worldly Pleaſures might have any part in their Affections, but God alone. Take courage, O my Soul, let us embrace the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and follow Jeſus Chriſt, who will conduct us through the garden of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights Let us not trouble our ſelves with World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Affairs, unleſs we know 'tis the Will of God; for otherwiſe we ſhall find affliction of Spirit, and decay in Spirituality. Thrice happy is he,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:57606:208"/> who ſhuns multiplicity, for this will diſpoſe him to pure Love.</p>
                  <p>Many things ſeem to us neceſſary, which ſerve but to entertain the corruption of Nature, ſtill working in us. If God ſhould ſeverely exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all our Actions, perhaps he would hardly find one in all reſpects well pleaſing to him. We too much follow Nature, and our Humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, if Grace ſets us a working, we hardly go through with it, but Nature creeps in ſome way or other to ſully our Actions. What is purely Natural, cannot be Meritorious, all merit proceeding from a Principle of Grace, and therefore no Actions but what have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence from Grace can diſpoſe us to a union with God. O how rare a thing is pure Virtue! That which ſeems beſt, is not for the moſt part without ſome blemiſh. Thoſe who have Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations from Heaven, diſcover theſe Impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, others in the dark ſee nothing but groſſer Faults and Imperfections.</p>
                  <p>From all this we may conclude, that there are principally four great Obſtacles, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the moſt part the exerciſe of Prayer. 1. <hi>To engage our ſelves in Worldly Affairs, more than the order of God requires.</hi> 2. <hi>To be too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate, and uſe very little Corporal Auſterity.</hi> 3. <hi>To practice little either Interiour or Exteriour Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats, and to have no Love for Recollection, and for Solitude.</hi> 4. <hi>Want of zeal and Courage in the ways of God, and ſo living a Life meerly Humane, by following our Naetural Inclinations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But he ſhall never be a Man of Prayer, who does not live a Super-natural Life, and practice
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:57606:209"/> all Chriſtian Virtues with a Faithful and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou Reſolution. And Bleſſed is he, who by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in Spiritual Exerciſes has brought his Soul to ſuch a temper, that 'tis in a manner as eaſie for him to Pray as breath. <hi>Hic accipiet Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictionem à Domino; &amp; Miſericordiam, à Deo Salutari ſuo, quia haec eſt generatio quaerentium Dominum, He that thus ſeeks God while he may be found, ſhall enjoy him there, where he can never be loſt.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Of the Means that facilitate the Exerciſe of</hi> Prayer.</head>
                  <p>WHoſoever is reſolved to undertake the Exerciſe of Prayer, muſt expect to ſuffer all ſorts of Temptations from Satan, who above all others, hate the Praying Nation: And no leſs from Nature, which hath ſtrange repugnances to ſo Crucifying a Life, and ſuch Exerciſes as elevate her above all her Natural Inclinations: And alſo from the World, which does not reliſh at all ſo much Solitude and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification. But we cannot be true Servants of Jeſus Chriſt Crucified, without taking up our <hi>Croſs</hi> to follow him. A Poor, Abject, Deſpiſed, Suffering Life, contented with pure Neceſſities for Food, and Cloathing, is a good Diſpoſition to Prayer.</p>
                  <p>It will very much diſpoſe us to this Holy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, to keep our ſelves in a Conformity to
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:57606:209"/> the ſtates of the Suffering Life of Jeſus Chriſt, and in the practice of pure Virtues on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. To eſteem the Sacred folly of the <hi>Croſs</hi> the greateſt Wiſdom, and correſpond to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations of Gods Holy Spirit, againſt all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition whatſoever that thwart the Deſigns of God, and hinders the operations of his Grace in us.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a great help to Prayer, to make it our ſole and only buſineſs; and doubtleſs of high concern, ſeeing 'tis to do that on Earth, which the Saints do in Heaven, to Contemplate and Love the Beauties of God. However, if we have other Affairs, at leaſt we muſt make this the principal, to which the reſt ought to give place; and not, as alas! too many do, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late our Devotions by our Secular Affairs. Why ſhould we overcharge our ſelves with Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by offering our ſervice to others on the pretence of Charity? <hi>Martha</hi> who was very buſie about the Corporal Service of Jeſus Chriſt, was reprov'd for troubling her ſelf with ſo many diſtracting Offices; and her Siſter commended for attending to the only thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, the Love of God and Contemplation.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a good help to Prayer, not to engage our ſelves in Worldly concerns, nor in giving or receiving Viſits without neceſſity, ſuch as the Oblations of Charity, or of our place and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition requires of us. If we be free, to ſhun all entertainments that are dangerous, or unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and chuſe to converſe with ſuch, who commonly diſcourſe about the one thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, which conſiſts in the Service of God,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:57606:210"/> and the exerciſe of Prayer. But all this muſt be ſo done, as our Diſcretion may not be call'd in queſtion, nor Charity wounded.</p>
                  <p>'Tis an important help to Prayer, to ſtand always upon our guard in the time of Sickneſs, or Indiſpoſition of Health, ſo as not wholly to leave off our uſual Exerciſes of Devotion. Under pretence to cheriſh the Body, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly yield too much to Nature, and ſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a ſhort Sickneſs we looſe long habits of Mortification, which coſt us dear in their acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. Prayer is not to be laid aſide at ſuch a time, but we muſt endeavour to keep up our Union with God by Interiour acts of Virtue, which require no ſtrength of Body, nor guſts of Devotion, but agree well enough with a ſtate of Trouble and Dereliction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis a very profitable help to Prayer, to accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom our ſelves to do nothing of concern with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a motion from God. The Holy Spirit is in us to conduct us, and we may ſafely follow ſuch a Leader. This keeps the Soul in great Purity, which knows the Inſpirations of Grace, by the Internal Peace, Sweetneſs and Liberty, that always more or leſs attend them. And if ſhe quit them to follow Nature, the ſecret ſtings of Conſcience tell her, ſhe has been Unfaithful to Gods Graces, and retarded her progreſs towards Perfection.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a very neceſſary help to Prayer, for a Soul to get a habit of being ſo dead to the World, as to live only to God, and in God, her only center and true repoſe. This is the end of our Creation, and if ſhe deviate therefrom, to
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:57606:210"/> take a complacency in her ſelf or any Creature, ſhe falls ſhort of the Deſigns of God. I know well enough that in the beginning of a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Life, 'tis very hard to bring our minds off from thinking on vain and Worldly matters, and to habituate the Soul to ſtrive againſt Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and adorn her ſelf with all Chriſtian Virtues. However ſhe muſt then reflect on her Imperfections, her good and evil Inclinations, as ſhe finds the motions of Grace to Dictate to her. She is not as yet capable of a more elevated degree of Prayer, and ſo her Thoughts are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably imploy'd in this lower exerciſe. But when God is pleas'd to enter into her, as to make her enter into him by a more intimate Union, her Thoughts then muſt be all upon God, and for him, ſeeing he is only her true reſt and repoſe.</p>
                  <p>Many Spiritual Perſons fail herein not well obſerving the method and ways of God in the conduct of Souls. They have not an eye ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere enough on their Interiour, to diſcover all the motions of the Heart, to examine, and ſearch, and find out the leaſt root of their Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. This muſt be done, and is good and profitable in its ſeaſon. But when God calls us to higher elevations in Prayer, we muſt follow the conduct of his Holy Spirit, or we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver advance in the ways of Perfection.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>That we muſt not preſume of our ſelves to attempt any manner of Prayer but what is ordinary.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IN our Spiritual Exerciſes we muſt ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily prepare the Subject of our Prayer and converſe with God. This is the Practice of all holy Perſons, and to do otherwiſe, is to fail in our reſpect to the Majeſty of Heaven. If we be to ſpeak to a King, or any Perſon of Quality, we think thereon aforehand; and ſhall we not have conſideration of what we have to ſay to the King of Glory?</p>
                  <p>This preparing of the matter of Prayer, muſt be done ſome little time, before we ſet upon the Duty. Then we muſt lift up our Hearts to God, and deſire him to put into our minds what may be moſt pleaſing to him in our Recollections; and what ever it be, to entertain it in our Thoughts, and dwell upon it, unleſs God inſpire us with ſome other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that calls upon us for our Attention and Fidelity. For to comply with this, we ought to quit the Subject we have prepared for our Exerciſe. Let us not ſoar above our Abilities, but make choice of ſuch matters for Prayer as are moſt ſuitable to our Spiritual State, and we find by our Interiour to be moſt agreeable to the will of God.</p>
                  <pb n="401" facs="tcp:57606:211"/>
                  <p> Let us never begin our Prayers, without asking God pardon of our Sins, and imploring his mercies. For to put our ſelves into his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Preſence, and to converſe with him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a deteſtation of theſe Imperfections where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we have diſpleaſed him, is to make our ſelves unworthy of his Grace and Favour.</p>
                  <p>'Tis of very great importance to know how God uſually conducts Souls to Perfection, that we may the better comply with the Deſigns of his Grace. All are not call'd to the ſame ſort of Prayer: and without a ſpecial Vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we ought not to apply our ſelves but to the more ordinary way of Devotion: whether we converſe with God by diſcurſive Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to raiſe our Affections, taking ſome Book to our Aſſiſtance: or whether we call to mind ſome Subject, wherein we formerly have found ſome Guſt and Spiritual Advantage. Let this be done with Humility, Dependance, and Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; for a Soul having no Call from God to a more elevated Prayer, if ſhe ceaſe her own Operations, ſhe ceaſes to Pray, and falls into Diſtractions, or is guilty of Idleneſs. But it is far otherwiſe with her, when ſhe is raiſed from Meditation by the workings of God in her to Prayer of Contemplation.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, that a Soul having plac'd her ſelf in the preſence of God, and thinking on the Subject ſhe has prepared, ought to meditate thereon with great attention of Spirit; but if God pleaſe to take her Thoughts up with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, ſhe ought without any Diſturbance, leave her own, to comply with the Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:57606:212"/> of Gods holy Spirit: For when God is thus pleaſed to poſſeſs a Soul by the operations of his Grace, ſhe ought to put no Obſtacle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: which we do too often by our Induſtries, which ſeem to us neceſſary, and without which we believe we ſhould do nothing: when as then we ſhould give way to thoſe Divine Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, to the end they may become more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious. Otherwiſe we have leſs reſpect for God, than we would have for ſome earthly Prince, to whom we ſpeak with much Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as long as he is pleaſed to give us Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but as ſoon as he thinks good to ſpeak, we preſently are ſilent, and give ear to his words with much Attention and Reſpect, not preſuming in the leaſt ſort to interrupt him.</p>
                  <p>Our principal affair is to ſerve God, the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num neceſſarium,</hi> recommended to us by our Bleſſed Saviour; and therefore it concerns us, not to diſtract our ſelves with too many exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Imployments, though good and lawful. Becauſe if the heart be bound with a Chain of Gold, 'tis no more at Liberty to converſe with God, than if it was fetter'd with Links of Iron. Wherefore whatever we can do for the Service of God, and Good of our Neighbour, let us do it with Willingneſs of Heart, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Talents and Abilities. But above all we muſt have an eſteem of Prayer, and a deſire to practiſe it; being firmly perſwaded, there's nothing whereby we can better ſerve God, or more profit our ſelves in a Spiritual Life. For my part I in ſome ſort more value Prayer, though imperfect, than the beſt Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:57606:212"/> that carry more of outward Splendour, and and ſeem more Glorious in the eyes of men.</p>
                  <p>We muſt therefore never be diſguſted with Prayer, nor quit the frequent Exerciſe thereof, becauſe we, to our thinking, make little Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement therein; but perſevere faithfully to practiſe it in the beſt manner we can, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect with patience the good pleaſure of God. If we do our Endeavours, we have diſcharg'd our Duty and Obligation. The Servant that had but one Talent, was blamed by his Lord, becauſe he did not improve it by his Induſtry.</p>
                  <p>When my Soul is not in a temper for the Exerciſe of Prayer, I uſe ſhort Reflections to call to mind what is moſt diſtaſtful to me; and I make a Reſolution to do it, or ſet upon it preſently, if I can: as to converſe with one, from whom I have an Averſion, or make ſome viſit, where I know I ſhall be much mortified; that I may conquer my ſelf in thoſe things, which raiſe a continual War within me. I have oftentimes by this facilited the Exerciſe of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, God being pleaſed by ſo much the more to diſpoſe our hearts, by how much the more we offer Violence to our ſelves, to ſurmount all Difficulties.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>How to paſs from Ordinary Prayer to</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.</head>
                  <p>A Soul that does not nouriſh in her ſelf any voluntary Imperfection, having efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſires to live the Life of Jeſus, ought to be paſſive to the Conduct of God in <hi>Prayer,</hi> and aſpire after great Simplicity, by giving a check to the Diſcourſe of her Underſtanding, and multiplicity of Acts in her Will and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I am not ignorant that ſhe ought to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe her ſelf in Meditation and a lower degree of <hi>Prayer,</hi> till God is pleaſed to raiſe her to Contemplation: but withall ſhe muſt elevate her ſelf as ſoon as ſhe feels interiour Attracts, and ſhun a falſe Humility, which hinders us to follow the Motions of God's holy Spirit, who communicates his Graces to the Perfect, to augment their Purity, and to the Imperfect, to purify their Souls from Terrene Deſires.</p>
                  <p>In my judgment 'tis of great importance in the Exerciſe of <hi>Prayer,</hi> to receive with Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity the impreſſion of the Rayes of the Divine Sun who rides in the Interiour of our Soul. 'Tis he that can enlighten us without the Succours of our Diſcourſe: who inflames us with Divine Love, without troubling our Will with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of a multiplicity of Acts, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner almoſt imperceptibly makes all Virtues to grow ripe in us, and arrive to Perfection. If a

                  <p>God does not work this but in ſuch a Soul that freely puts her ſelf into his Hands, with all ſubmiſſive Humility, to be guided by Him.

                  <p>Nevertheleſs I believe, we may profitably deſcend to a lower Degree of <hi>Prayer,</hi> when we have no Overture to one more elevated: but this is not to be done, till we often knock at the gate of Mercy with a holy Importunity. But if the Bridegroom of our Souls is not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to vouchſafe us a Kiſs of his Lips by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, let us keep our ſelves at his Feet by Converſing with him in Meditation.</p>
                  <p>It will much conduce to elevate a Soul to a more perfect Union with God, to have in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory many univerſal Verities of the Divinity and Sacred Humanity of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>Of the Prayer of Faith.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THis Prayer is a bare reflection or ſimple re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of God, who is believed by naked Faith, as he is ſeen and known by the Light of Glory. 'Tis the ſame Object here and there, but known by the Soul in a different manner. The way of knowing God here, is but learned Ignorance. Earth is the Land of Believing, Heaven of Seeing, To ſee God as we are ſeen
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:57606:215"/> of Him, and underſtand all Divine Myſteries, is reſerv'd for the Light of Glory; here we muſt walk by the obſcurities of Faith.</p>
                  <p>This Faith muſt be naked without Images or Repreſentations, ſimple and without Diſcourſe, univerſal without a diſtinct conſideration of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The operation of the Will is conform to that of the Underſtanding, Naked, Simple, Univerſal, Spiritual, Independant on the Senſes. We muſt expect great Combats in this way from our Spirit, which will ſtill be working, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on Creatures. But though it be much diſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by the underſtanding part of the Soul, yet ſhe muſt ſtrive to die to her own operations, and willingly entertain what helps her in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, as Aridities, Privations, Deſolations, which at laſt leave the Soul in exerciſe of pure Faith; whereby God is known in a higher man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, than thoſe Lights which ſerve as a <hi>Medium</hi> between God and the Soul, for this Union of our Spirit with God by pure Faith is immediate, and ſo more elevated. The Will alſo muſt die to what ever is not God. To live only in Him, and to him by pure Love. For the Life of the Will is this Death; and this Death is not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily wrought but by Privations.</p>
                  <p>This kind of Prayer is uniform, and not much lyable to alterations, nor brings any damage to the Body. For Nature has nothing to do in it, being not procurable by greateſt endeavours of Humane Induſtry, but depending purely on the Will of God, who alone gives it when and to whom he pleaſes. 'Tis true, this pure and naked Contemplation of God by Faith is given
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:57606:215"/> but rarely, and to thoſe who have paſt through many Purgatories and ſtates of Penance, to fit them for it. In the beginning it darts into the Soul but Tranſient Irradiations, like flaſhes of Lightning; if at any time they continue about half an hour, 'tis very much: However they work in the Soul very great Effects.</p>
                  <p>One of the principal is, that this Light of Faith diſcovers to us the verity of Divine My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, Imperfections, and the Perfections we want, and practical Virtues: And all this at once, not ſucceſſively one after another by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which could never arrive to produce a knowledge ſo clear and univerſal. But indeed the underſtanding, has much ado to die to its own operations, and not act by Humane Lights, by being wholly given up to the obſcurity of Faith. However this muſt be done, to be rightly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for Divine Operations.</p>
                  <p>There are divers degrees of Contemplations, but what God is pleas'd to give us, muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with ſubmiſſive Thankfulneſs. While we live in Mortal Bodies, we ſhall have always ſomething to purifie, and therefore always ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſuffer, Three parts of our Life paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in a Suffering condition. In a ſtate of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, the Soul is intimately united to God, although ſhe be not ſenſible thereof. I am much taken with the way of pure Faith in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whereby the Soul knows God as much as ſhe can do in this Life; and though it be obſcure, it matters not, being ſure and certain. For my part, take as much as you will of my Light of Reaſon, if the Light of Faith increaſe thereby. O how Beautiful is pure and naked Faith!</p>
                  <pb n="410" facs="tcp:57606:216"/>
                  <p> It much conduces to Spiritualize a Soul, to live continually by Faith, to eſteem and love nothing, but what we ought to eſteem and love. Man rarely will relinquiſh his Reaſon, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs he muſt raiſe himſelf above it, or drag on the Earth with Imperfections. Faith is a participation of the Eternal Wiſdom, ſhe only conducts us with true aſſurance; for her Lights though dark, are certain, and their obſcurity does incomparably tranſcend the cleareſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Natural Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, to make Prayer more Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and that Nature may have no hand in it, we muſt leave off ſome things, which uſually did raiſe our hearts to God with a ſenſible Devotion: As <hi>Muſick,</hi> Rich Ornaments, Devout Pictures in Churches, and the like. This is good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable in the beginning of a Spiritual Life, and ſome time after; but when a Soul has attained purity of Prayer, there's no need to take her nouriſhment, that is, her Knowledge and Love but from pure Faith and Supernatural Lights infuſed into her. When we take not good heed, we keep not our ſelves ſufficiently paſſive to the Operations of God, but we go a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Life of the Soul to ſenſible Objects, when God himſelf would nouriſh her with more purified Knowledge, and Diviner Love:</p>
                  <p>Why ſhould we hanker after ſenſible Guſts of Devotion, ſeeing Nature is commonly too much taken with them, to the damage of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Faith, and the hindrance of our pure Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, which requires a total denudati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Creatures? Notwithſtanding when
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:57606:216"/> God tryes us with Derelictions, and gives us not admittance into his preſence, but by things ſenſible and Diſcourſive Prayer; we muſt humb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comply with this ſtate, and not pretend to higher elevations in our Addreſſes to him.</p>
                  <p>Yet if a Soul in this Interiour Poverty and Dereliction finds that ſhe has a call to Interiour Sufferings, ſhe ought not to ſeek after ſenſible things to raiſe her to God; but couragiouſly bear this Interiour <hi>Croſs,</hi> as long as it pleaſes her Divine Bridegroom to continue her Tryal. This ſtate is bitter indeed, but withall purifying, and makes a Soul capable of more intimate union with God.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. X. <hi>Of the Sacred Darkneſs of</hi> Prayer.</head>
                  <p>ON St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>'s day it ſeem'd to me, that my Prayer chang'd, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more ſimple, more ſtrong and elevated. My Spirit went on knowing God, not by Lights or Guſts of Devotion, but by a certain Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wherewith God is ſurrounded as with a Cloud. This Darkneſs made me ſee that God cannot be known, but is Infinitely above our underſtanding, which cannot better know him, then by acknowledging we cannot know him as he is. At other times Guſts and Lights were inſtrumental to unite me to God, but now this Darkneſs only was my Guide, and my Soul find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf loſt in a profound Ignorance of
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:57606:217"/> God, yet ſeem'd to me to know him better than ever, and I had no difficulty to Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate God in this manner; which leaving in me deep impreſſions of the Divinity, did alſo augment my Interiour diſpoſitions of the Love of God, hatred of ſin, and ſuch like matters.</p>
                  <p>It ſeem'd to me that at this time my Prayer became more continual. And I was much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd with that ſaying of St. <hi>Denis, That this ignorance is the beſt and higheſt knowledge we have here of God.</hi> I therefore readily made my Addreſſes to God in the aforeſaid manner, underſtanding well, that the knowledge we have of God by this way, is greater than that we learn by diſcourſe, or Lights, or Guſts in Prayer. To know we cannot know God, is to know him as much as he can be known in this Life, his Grandeurs being Infinitely above our Underſtanding. And that our Underſtanding may live wholly to God, it muſt die to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is not God, whom we ſee by naked Faith in a Luminous obſcurity.</p>
                  <p>By this way God is more known and lov'd, than by many Lights and Affections, all which are loſt in the obſcurity of this Sacred Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which makes a Soul ſee that the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God are incomprehenſible. Many good effects ariſe from hence: As a profound Joy and Peace of Conſcience, a firmneſs in our good Reſolutions, and practice of Virtues, a great love of Self-denyal, in imitation of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Humiliations of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>One of the ſureſt marks to know whether this Prayer of Darkneſs comes from God, is to ſee
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:57606:217"/> whether it leave in the Soul the knowledge of our Miſeries and Infidelities: For the more we poſſeſs God, the better we ſee the leaſt Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. As for example, whether our inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be pure, or Nature has ſome Intereſt with Grace: Whether we too eaſily leave the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God for other things: Whether we comply with Gods Inſpirations, or commit In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelities. Theſe and ſuch like being clearly ſeen by this means, do much humble us, and make us careful to amend them.</p>
                  <p>The Soul in this diſpoſition knows nothing of God but that he is Incomprehenſible, and looſes her ſelf in this Darkneſs that ſurrounds his Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deurs. This view with a view ſees nothing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly of God in particalar, but is a <hi>knowing Ignorance</hi> of what God is in himſelf. For though the exceſſive Glory of this <hi>Divine Sun</hi> makes his Light inacceſsable to our weak eyes, yet this Darkneſs pierces our Interiour, and we know God in a tranſcendent manner by ſtrong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the Divinity, and are rais'd to a moſt intimate union with him. God requires of a Soul great Purity in this ſtate.</p>
                  <p>This then is an excellent manner to take up our Thoughts with God in our Addreſſes to him, by annihilating all our Lights and Knowledge, to get into this Sacred Darkneſs that ſurrounds his Glory, that being thus dead to our own Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, we may confeſs that God is as much above our Underſtanding, as he is amiable above our Affections. Thus to know God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs he is above our Underſtanding; and to love God, and acknowledge we cannot Love him
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:57606:218"/> according to his Perfections, is to live dead to our Selves and our Abilities; and ſuch God Loves beſt and knows with Approbation.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>Of the Lights of</hi> Prayer.</head>
                  <p>GOd ſometimes in Prayer diſcovers himſelf to a Soul, as the <hi>Sun,</hi> filling her with Light, by which and in which he is known, and all other things ſhe ſtands in need of, or which the Omniſcient is pleas'd to manifeſt to her. We ſee well enough this Light, by which we know God, but God himſelf is inacceſsable: As we behold the Light of the Natural <hi>Sun,</hi> and not the Body thereof, which blinds our Eyes, and by the benefit of its Beams the things of this World are made viſible to us.</p>
                  <p>One born Blind imagins that if he could ſee the Light, he might ſee the <hi>Sun:</hi> But he would find by experience, that this Light would only ſerve to make him clearly ſee, that he cannot behold the <hi>Sun</hi> by reaſon of its exceſſive Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. In the ſame manner when we are in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour Darkneſs, we think we can know God better in the Light, and when this Light comes, it only ſerves to let us ſee, that God cannot be known by us in Mortal Bodies.</p>
                  <p>When in Prayer I have a view of God, or ſome of his Perfections, of Jeſus, or ſome of his Diſpoſitions, or Maxims; it ſeems to me, that all theſe Objects have a particular Light in
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:57606:218"/> them, which ſerves much to diſcover their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency to the Soul. But it ſeems to me that theſe Verities, namely, <hi>We muſt ſlee from Evil, and do Good, hate Sin and embrace Virtue,</hi> and ſuch like, as conſidered barely in themſelves have no particular Light in them, to manifeſt their Goodneſs: But their Beauty and Excellency are diſcover'd to us by help of the Light of Faith: As thoſe Bodies which are out of the <hi>Sun,</hi> ſee not themſelves but by the Light thereof.</p>
                  <p>For this reaſon I believe 'tis beſt for a Soul to take up her Thoughts with God, and thoſe Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities that regard him; or with Jeſus, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Truths, as reſident in this Sacred Breaſt. By this means the Heart and Affections will be much inflam'd with the Love of God, to adore and ſerve him, and imitate the Perfections of Jeſus Chriſt. This ſort of Prayer is ſimple, and does not put the Soul to the labour of much Diſcourſe. For any Divine Perfection, and the Exteriour effects thereof, are ſeen by her at once, by a ſingular act of the underſtanding. As ſhe may conſider the Omnipotency by its ſelf, or together with the Creation of the World, ſhe may behold and adore the Divine Providence by it ſelf; together with its admirable effects in the Government of the Univerſe. The Soul herein needs not multiply Diſcourſes, but may behold all this at one proſpect.</p>
                  <p>When we meditate on any Chriſtian Verity; as for example, the Excellency of Poverty, without the Relation it hath to Jeſus, the Soul looſing the ſight thereof, falls into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction, being carried inſenſibly to a different
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:57606:219"/> matter: But when ſhe conſiders Poverty as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhrin'd in the heart of Jeſus, and practis'd by him, ſhe is taken up with Jeſus, which is much better. And ſo this digreſſion proves profitable, and ſhe gains by this loſs. 'Tis the ſame, when we meditate on any Perfection of God, and falling from our firſt ſubject, we are happily loſt in the depths of the Divinity, where we find no Love but of God himſelf. O Happy loſs.</p>
                  <p>There's no knowledge more neceſſary for us, than of our Miſeries and Imperfections, becauſe that, or nothing, will well ground us in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, without which we cannot raiſe Virtues to any height in a Spiritual Life. We may get this knowledge two manner of ways: Either directly, by conſidering them in themſelves: <hi>Vir videns paupertatem meam;</hi> Or by conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Divine Perfections, in the Light where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by reflection we diſcover our own Miſeries and Imperfections.</p>
                  <p>The firſt manner is ſomewhat like a Winters<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, wherein we feel nothing but Cold, and ſee nothing but Sterility; yet it affords Light enough to work in us a low eſteem of our ſelves: But this Humility oftentimes cauſes in the Soul diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, dependency, and diſcouragement. The other manner reſembles a fair Summers-day, which is more Warm and Lightſome, and full of Refreſhment. The ſight of our Miſeries by this way is more advantagious, and begets in us a more generous Humility, and fuller of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in God. For the view of the Divine Perfections, which is the chief and direct work of the Soul, raiſes in her a Holy Fire, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:57606:219"/> her Affections towards God in the midſt of her Miſeries.</p>
                  <p>Behold now the reaſon, why 'tis a great ſecret in a Spiritual Life, to behold all things of God, who is an Infinite Light; and never to forſake him, becauſe in him and by him we can beſt know and do our Duty.</p>
                  <p>After that a Soul is habituated to march through the ways of Faith and Purity, ſhe gets ſo great a Facility to converſe with God, that 'tis a trouble to her to deſcend to Creatures, knowing by experience that he only is her cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where ſhe finds true repoſe, and her only Light to conduct her to Happineſs. The Soul of Jeſus Chriſt, our Grand Exemplar, did not only abide in God by Apoſtatical Union, but all his Thoughts and Affections were abſorpt in the Divinity, which repleniſh'd this admirable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with Grace, Light, and Truth, for the Execution of the Eternal Decrees of his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father for the Redemption of Man. He finiſh'd the Myſteries of his Mortal Life, but ſtill converſing with God, and plung'd in the Divinity, wherein he beheld what he came to do upon Earth.</p>
                  <p>Let us follow his example, that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from God a Light to conduct us, which ordinarily is communicated to us in Prayer. <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedite ad eum, &amp; illuminamini. Draw near to God, and ye ſhall be Enlightned.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>Of Paſſive Prayer.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>PAſſive Prayer is after this manner. <hi>We take a view of God in his Perfections, or of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus in his states, or of ſome Chriſtian Verity, by the Light of Faith: and then the Soul abides in a perfect repoſe, gently receiving the Divine Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; which enter with ſo much Conviction, that ſhe is preſently warm'd and inflam'd with all ſorts of Vertues. And though ſhe does not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly practiſe their interiour acts, yet ſhe feels a delightful Joy by the ſweetneſs of thoſe impreſſions, and finds her ſelf well aispos'd to be faithful to them on all occaſions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Meditation God works with us, but we in a manner do all: in paſſive <hi>Prayer</hi> we co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate with God, but in a manner the whole work is his. We muſt not eaſily believe that we are in a ſtate of paſſive <hi>Prayer.</hi> To be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed thereto requires great Purity, and long Practice of <hi>Prayer,</hi> with the advice of a good Director, and in the <hi>interim</hi> to exerciſe our ſelves in Meditation.</p>
                  <p>A Soul elevated to the ſtate of paſſive <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> finds her ſelf united to God, without any Labour of her own, and receives from him many Lights and Illuſtrations, Deſires and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, according to his various Workings in her. Then the Soul purely adheres to Grace, holding cloſe to the Infuſions of God's holy
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:57606:220"/> Spirit, and follows the Divine Motions, by the Annihilations of her proper Operations. When ſhe is thus paſſive and dead to her ſelf, her ſtate changes not, although her ordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions may alter; for then ſhe receives with equal Contentment from the hand of God, Darkneſs as Light, Aridities as Comforts, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty as Abundance, in a firm Reſolution to will nothing but what pleaſes God, with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Indifferency, and a perfect Death to her own Operations.</p>
                  <p>'Tis obſervable in this paſſive ſtate, that the Soul ſometimes remains in Union with God, and Contemplation of his Divine Perfections, keeping her ſelf in a profound Repoſe, as it were without Action: and at other times ſhe acts by her own Faculties, as it pleaſes God to excite her to theſe Acts, her only buſineſs being to ſubmit perfectly to the Motions of Grace, and ſhe acting as Grace excites her, does not leave her ſtate of Paſſivity, ſeeing ſhe only moves her ſelf according to the Motions of God's Spirit.</p>
                  <p>A Soul cannot arrive to this paſſive ſtate, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſhe be dead to her ſelf, unleſs ſhe be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in Virtue, unleſs her Interiour Peace be great and ſtable, unleſs her <hi>Prayer</hi> be in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner continual, and unleſs ſhe be purifyed from all voluntary Defects. For how can God in ſuch a gracious manner viſit a Soul, which is free from Diſquiet and Ordinary Imperfections? How can ſhe hear the Voice of God amongſt the Noiſe of Creatures, if they live in her with any Affection? To put our ſelves into the hands
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:57606:221"/> of God, to do with us what he pleaſes in our Addreſſes to him, we muſt be exactly attentive to his Orders which he will interiourly make known to us, either by Illuſtrations in our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, or Inſtincts and Motions in our Will.</p>
                  <p>Perfect Purity of Heart requires, that the Soul have no Eye to her own Intereſt, but ſolely to do the Will of God. Her principal Care muſt only be to regard him, to love and ſerve him, without curiouſly examining his Gifts and Graces, ſhe knows well enough that in paſſive <hi>Prayer</hi> there are many wayes to come to God, and divers manners to ſacrifice our ſelves to Divine Love. Some ſpend themſelves in doing Good to their Neighbour, others in Suffering for their Faith by the Cruelty of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, ſome by Mortifications and Penances, others by Ardours of Love in <hi>Prayer.</hi> The Soul muſt be indifferent to be ſacrific'd by Love, what way beſt pleaſes God; the Divine will being the ſole Rule of her Choice, and not the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Perfection of the State; ſo that when ſhe knows it is God's Will, a leſs elevated Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is pleaſing to her.</p>
                  <p>God is our Father and Directour, operating in us in different manners. Sometimes he infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes more Light into the Underſtanding, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more Love into the Will, ſo that one Faculty ſeems to be loſt in the other, The Soul muſt be content with either, as God pleaſes, and ceaſe her own Operations, to be paſſive to the Actings of God in her by his gracious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. A great deal of Work is done for us by
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:57606:221"/> this means in a little time, towards Chriſtian Perfection.</p>
                  <p>The Soul that is in this ſtate, muſt carefully ſhun two things: the Activity of her own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the Impurity of her Affection. As for the firſt, our Spirit is very unwilling to dy to it ſelf, but will be acting and diſcourſing, we loving much our own Operations: ſo that we have much ado to conquer our ſelves, that we may enter into an entire Paſſivity, as to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuſceptible of Divine Motions. The long Habitudes of acting with Liberty hinders this Annihilation; but we muſt fight for the Victory, and Grace at laſt will make it eaſy.</p>
                  <p>As for the ſecond, the Impurity of Affection, we muſt be perfectly dead to whatſoever is not God, ſo as to ſeek nothing but him, and his good Pleaſure, without any mixture of Self-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts. The infinite Love of God to us obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges us to be faithful to him; and the Love we ought to have for our own good, obliges us to ſpare no pains to attain to Perfection.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>Of Pure and Perfect</hi> Prayer.</head>
                  <p>IT much diſpoſes a Soul to attain to pure and perfect Prayer, to give her ſelf up into the hands of God with an entire Submiſſion to his holy Will touching this Exerciſe, to beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her what ſtate he pleaſes. A Soul that finds Attracts from God to depend on his Providence,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:57606:222"/> the Matter and Manner of her <hi>Prayer,</hi> muſt receive thankfully what comes from God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be Contemplatio or Meditation, be it with Delight or Difficulty, with Sweetneſs or Aridities. A Soul ſo purely united to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will, and dead to all things elſe, poſſeſſes God in a wonderful manner, not only in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations, but Interiour Croſſes.</p>
                  <p>Purity of <hi>Prayer,</hi> as the preſent Light I have tells me, conſiſts in a ſimple View of God by the Light of Faith, without Diſcourſe or Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. Reaſon and Imagination have their part in Meditation, but not in pure <hi>Prayer.</hi> It ſeems to me that the Soul ought to be abſorpt in God, and remain there in repoſe, being dead as it were to her own Operations. This Repoſe in God is by Knowledge and Love, whereof ſometimes this, ſometimes that is more abundant, and affects the Soul as God pleaſes.</p>
                  <p>When God elevates a Soul above ordinary Prayer, to converſe with him alone, ſhe muſt make it her buſineſs to comply with him. The Virtues and Diſpoſitions, which another time would be the Life of the Soul, are not now, when ſhe muſt live no Life but the Life of God, that is of his ſole Knowledge and Love, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Reflection on her ſelf. God then takes the Care himſelf of ſuch a Soul, furniſhing her with all neceſſary Diſpoſitions. <hi>Think on me, and I will think on thee,</hi> ſaid <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to St. <hi>Catherine.</hi> In <hi>Prayer</hi> God infuſes into her pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Lights of no long Durance, but efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: and out of <hi>Prayer</hi> ſhe receives the ſame,
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:57606:222"/> to be applyed to the Practice of moſt excellent Virtues on all occaſions.</p>
                  <p>Pure and Perfect <hi>Prayer</hi> does not conſiſt in Guſts of Devotion, but in the ſupreme part of the Spirit in a peculiar manner, that is inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable. For this ſupreme Region of the Soul is the ſacred Temple, where God is pleas'd to dwell, where ſhe feels and taſts a Sweetneſs above all created Entities. The Soul conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Faith, and attracted by theſe Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes, finds God in this his Sanctuary, and converſes with him with ſuch a Familiarity, as aſtoniſhes the Angels to behold it. 'Tis here where ſhe makes pure <hi>Prayer,</hi> ſeeing there's nothing but God and the Soul, without any Creature to interrupt this ſacred Interview, God working all that paſſes by Himſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Repreſentations, or Diſcourſes, or Guſts of Devotion. This ſupreme part of the Soul being not capable of ſenſible Objects, God alone takes Poſſeſſion thereof, communicating his Illuſtrations and Sentiments, which are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for a pure Union with him.</p>
                  <p>Perfect <hi>Prayer</hi> then is a certain experiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Manifeſtation, which God gives of Himſelf, of his Goodneſs, Peace, and Sweetneſs. An ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Gift, that is not imparted but to the pureſt Souls, and ordinarily is but of ſmall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance. But the Condition of Mortality will not permit of more, where we muſt live in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, Patience, and Sufferings. The Soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from theſe Divine Embraces, carries away with her great Love, and a high Eſteem of God, a profound Knowledge of her own
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:57606:223"/> Imperfections, and finds her ſelf altogether diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to act and ſuffer, and practiſe pure Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues on all occaſions.</p>
                  <p>Few perſons arrive to this Purity of perfect <hi>Prayer,</hi> becauſe few make themſelves ſuſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible of thoſe Divine Motions, by an entire Annihilation of their own Powers. Theſe great Favours would be more frequently beſtow'd, if we had Hearts prepared to recive them; Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours which are of more worth than the whole World, and cannot be known but by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. For my part, I know nothing, I only have heard ſay, that in this pure and perfect <hi>Prayer,</hi> there are admirable Unions, moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Embraces, Ardours of Love, ſo Pure, as may almoſt compare with the Flames of Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims.</p>
                  <p>We come to a perfect Union with God by a perfect Denudation of all Creatures; and this Denudation is acquir'd by continual Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſometimes by Divine Infuſion. We muſt therefore pray much, and dye daily to our ſelves and all Creatures. Since that Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin hath depraved our Nature, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live a Life of Grace, without dying a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Death. When God acts with us in the Practice of Mortification, we ſhall ſoon dye to our ſelves, for he breaks us all to pieces on a ſudden with wonderful Contrition of Heart, and kills our Corruptions unknown to us: ſo that a Soul dies more in one day by the loving Stroaks of his powerful Hand, than ſhe would in ſome years by ordinary Mortifications.</p>
                  <pb n="425" facs="tcp:57606:223"/>
                  <p> Let us therefore adore this Divine and lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hand which kills us, to make us live; and never complain but of the little Returns we make for his gracious Favours. The Loſs of Goods, of Friends, of Honours, of Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, do much conduce to bring a Soul to this living Death; for commonly we quit ſuch al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurement, when we loſe the materials of thoſe Fetters.</p>
                  <p>In this Divine Exerciſe the Soul is wholly taken up with God, without diverting her Thoughts on any other Object. And though then to reflect on the effects of Prayer, would be a kind of Diſtraction, yet without her think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, God leaves powerful Impreſſions in her, and pregnant Diſpoſitions to practiſe great Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and above all a love of the <hi>Croſs</hi> and Humiliations, ſeeing he cannot poſſibly pleaſe God more than by ſuffering for Him.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XIV. <hi>Of the Hungring of the Soul after GOD, and of her being Satiated with Him.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>I Sometimes find my ſelf in a <hi>Prayer</hi> of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, which I may call a Hungring after God. For my intellectual Will had a ſtrong Appetite for God, without any Production of other particular Acts of Love or Complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as when we have a longing after Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, without a Deſire of this or that, but only we have a hungry Diſpoſition. In this ſtate
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:57606:224"/> the Soul only Thirſts after God, as known by Faith in a general manner.</p>
                  <p>This Prayer was very Intellectual, my Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Appetite had rarely any part in it; I neither ſent up Sighs nor Ejaculations; and it ſeem'd to me to be compatible with ſome Affairs, and did continue though the Soul had Diſtractions in the imagination and underſtanding. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought this Prayer was wholly Spiritual; for I know not how it came into my Soul, nor what it did there, only I felt a Hungring and Thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after God; and it ſeem'd to me, that I might ſtill hunger after him, though I did poſſeſs him. This Prayer may be of long du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, without breaking the Brain, but we muſt be dead to Nature whilſt it continues:</p>
                  <p>I felt alſo in my ſelf a Hungring after the ſtates of Jeſus Chriſt, the poſſeſſion whereof is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to the Purity of Love, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly diſpoſes us to it: Whoſoever deſires pure Love, muſt have a deſire of them alſo; the one not ſubſiſting without the other. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at preſent inſtead of fearing Poverty, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it: Inſtead of Fearing to Suffer, I have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations to it. And my delight is, to take my <hi>Croſs,</hi> and follow Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>This kind of Prayer did appeaſe Interiour Combates and Struglings in me, and I found in my ſelf ſome aſſurance of a Suffering, Humble ſtate, where God will have us live purely of Him, and for Him. What is more purely for God, than that which has nothing of ſelf in it? Grace carries us to a Love of Poverty, and what ſeems contrary to our particular good,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:57606:224"/> which we relinquiſh voluntarily, that we may advance the ſole Intereſts of God. A Soul that lives this Life, lives in Purity of Love, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipates of the pure Virtues of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>O what generous Reſolutions muſt a Soul have to Love God purely? She muſt deny her ſelf to pleaſe God only. There's no living a Life of Grace, without a continual violence to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Inclinations, by taking up our <hi>Croſs</hi> to follow Jeſus. We confeſs, O good Jeſus, that except your Grace always prevent and follow us, we ſhall never reliſh well this Sacred Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Sufferings, and Humiliations, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty; which is ſome ſmall participation of your Abjections.</p>
                  <p>It often comes to paſs, that God, who opens his Liberal hand to fill all Creatures with his Bleſſings, is pleas'd to ſatisfie this hunger he has rais'd in a Soul, by communicating himſelf to her in ſuch a manner, that ſhe finds her ſelf wholly contented; and full of God. This ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God being once taſted, the Soul is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh'd with Joy and Sweetneſs. This diſpoſition ſometimes ſo totally poſſeſſes all the Powers of the Soul, Underſtanding, Will, Memory, Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, that there's no room for other Thoughts to enter, being wholly taken up with God. Prayer then is a feeling of God filling the Heart with Joy and Contentment. O when will it pleaſe your Infinite Goodneſs to infuſe into Souls ſome little participation of this Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that they may purely rejoyce in you who only can give us this ſatisfaction! This is a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying Fulneſs indeed, that leaves no place for other deſires.</p>
                  <pb n="428" facs="tcp:57606:225"/>
                  <p> This Prayer is rarely granted unleſs to Souls much mortified, and well advanced in the ways of God. For a Soul muſt be emptyed of all Creatures, before God can fill it. When a Soul finds her ſelf thus ſatisfied with God, ſhe muſt yield her ſelf paſſive to the workings of Grace, and ſhe will feel in her Interiour ſuch a content and ſweetneſs, as will render diſguſtful to her whatever is not God.</p>
                  <p>I find this diſpoſition different from that which ordinarily we receive by Union with God. This ſatisfaction being a more profound and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate poſſeſſion of God, making all Comforts from Creatures, even moſt pleaſing to us; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come diſtaſtful, in compariſon of thoſe Joyes, that raviſh'd the Soul in this diſpoſition.</p>
                  <p>This Satisfaction and Contentment does ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Exteriourly ſhow it ſelf, the Senſes being ſo affected therewith; that if ſuch perſons im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themſelves about any ſenſible object, they do it as if they were a ſleep.</p>
                  <p>The Diſpoſitions God is pleas'd to give me, increaſe in me daily a new deſire of Solitude and Contempt of the World; where I find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Impediments to my Union with God. And ſeeing all my deſires tend that way, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diverts me from it is diſpleaſing to me.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems to me, I am now no more fit for Worldly Affairs, and I look upon my ſelf as an old piece of Houſhold ſtuff, that is good for little or nothing but the Fire; for methinks, God would have me do nothing hereafter, but burn with the Sacred Fire of Divine Love. Or like a poor Criple, who cannot work for his Living, I muſt
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:57606:225"/> die of Hunger: That is, my Soul having a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Hunger and Thirſt after God, muſt die to all things but God himſelf, her ſole repoſe and ſatisfaction.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XV. <hi>Of Infuſed</hi> Prayer.</head>
                  <p>OUr Bleſſed Saviour has been ſo Merciful, as to give me, to my thinking, ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and experience of infus'd Prayer. In my Morning Prayer I found my ſelf in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God in ſilence with Admiration, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and Peace. This took me up a long time, and though ſome Temptations aroſe in Inferiour Nature, yet the Superiour part of my Soul remain'd united to God, without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to her Interiour quiet. This Peace and Tranquility was greater than ordinary, more Solid and more Aſſured.</p>
                  <p>I conceive alſo that what God is thus pleas'd to infuſe into us, be it Light or Affection, Peace or Love, 'tis hidden from Deceits of Nature, the Temptations of Satan, and the noiſe of Creatures. For God immediately infuſes it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the center of the Soul, without the Miniſtry of our Senſes, and ſo is not lyable to their on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fets and viciſſitudes, but always remains entire, as long as it pleaſes God to continue his ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
                  <p>I alſo conceive very well, that the Interiour of Soul is a Sacred Manſion where God reſides,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:57606:226"/> and does his works Independant on all Humane Induſtry and endeavours. There he ſometimes manifeſts Himſelf and his Perfections, ſometimes Chriſtian Myſteries after what manner he thinks beſt. It ſeems to me that the leaſt Ray from his preſence is enough to make known to us what he pleaſes. <hi>Illuminet vultum ſuum ſuper nos.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a very great favour for God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with the Soul alone in her Interiour. I am now no more aſtoniſh'd at what the Saints affirm, that their heart is a Tabernacle, where God dwells with him, and they enjoy him in a wonderful manner: Nor that Souls of much Prayer do this without labour, and almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually; for receiving ſo much, and labouring ſo little, I do not wonder at the Facility.</p>
                  <p>The Soul thus conducted into the Cabinet of her Heart, receives a great diſcovery of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Nature and Grace, not only ordinary, but thoſe which are moſt hard to be diſcerned. Knowing very well that God Communicates himſelf unto her by Infuſion, ſhe correſponds to his motions, and becomes paſſive to his opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>The Truths ſhe ſees by this infuſed Light makes deeper impreſſions, then when diſcover'd by Meditation. And the Soul conceives far otherwiſe of Virtues, of Reformation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and how to Act and Suffer for God. It ſeems to her that now ſhe begins to quit her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Inclinations, wherein ſhe continued with much Imperfection; and becomes more ſtrong and generous, and more reſolv'd to act for God.</p>
                  <pb n="431" facs="tcp:57606:226"/>
                  <p> Except I deceive my ſelf, God has been pleas'd to put me in this ſtate by his actings in me. But withall he makes me know, that more Purity and Fidelity is required than ever, by dying to our ſelves, and the World, to do his Will; and more Humility by acknowledging our ſelves unworthy of his Graces; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to ordinary Prayer, when he leaves us in Aridities, and to bear them with content and reſignation. I have ſeen but a ſmall glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this elevated Prayer, to make me the more to aſpire after a fuller view, to abandon all to poſſeſs this entirely, to enjoy this Happy hour, one moment whereof is worth a thouſand Worlds. Seeing God is pleas'd thus to favour us, why ſhould we refuſe his Mercies, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining our ſelves in lower Exerciſes?</p>
                  <p>I have now no more difficulty to underſtand, how the knowledge of many Verities are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in a Soul that is unlearned, and not verſt in acquir'd Sciences: And how by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour Light ſhe ſees things without her a far off: And how ſhe can know the Perfections of God, and her own Imperfections. Here is the Cabinet of God, all the World does not enter into it, neither is the door always open. Come my Soul, let us knock at the door thereof with an humble confidence; if God is not pleas'd to open it, let us wait there with content and quiet, and practice Patience. The times of Gods Viſits depend only on his good pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>If the Interiour of the heart be not well pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, it will not be diſpoſed to receive theſe Infuſions and Divine Communications, for Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:57606:227"/> and Impurity cannot agree. I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo convinced as now, that all things are to be forſaken to attend to God alone; and for this end to love Contempts, Poverty, and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and that Grace requires of me to obey this Divine Call with Fidelity, not fearing the Inconveniencies of Poverty, but depending confidently on the ſupport of Providence.</p>
                  <p>After that a Soul has received the impreſſion of the Divinity in Infuſed Prayer, ſhe ſees and finds God every where, by a ſecret of Love, only known to them who have experience thereof. Love has wonderful piercing Eyes, which reſts not on the outſide of Creatures, but paſſes through to the Divinity that lyes there hidden.</p>
                  <p>In like manner when the Soul has impreſſions of Jeſus in Infuſed Prayer, ſhe ſees and finds him every where. For that intimate Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication which Jeſus makes of himſelf to the Interiour Powers of the Soul, ſo takes them up, that the Soul ſees Jeſus in all things, who is the only Object of her Love; to whom ſhe is ſo united, as never to ſuffer a ſeparation. O how great is the Grace of Infuſed Prayer, and how Happy is that Soul who is partaker there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?</p>

                  <p>BEhold what our Bleſſed Saviour has made me underſtand by Experience of this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Prayer.</hi> In my <hi>Prayer</hi> I found all my Powers in a Calm, and fill'd with great Peace and Sweetneſs, which proceeded from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God in my Interiour, whom there I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held reſiding and working many Graces. Whilſt this holds the Soul, as it were aſleep, in quiet, ſhe rejoyces; and this Joy is infus'd into her, and hardly knows how ſhe rejoyces, feeling only in her Interiour a Sweetneſs and delightful Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity: yet well perceiving God works this in her by his Preſence.</p>
                  <p>God likewiſe gives her great Aſſurance of his Preſence, and experimental Knowledge that he is infinitely Good, Powerful, Merciful, her only Soveraign and final Happineſs. The Soul perceives well enough, that ſhe now conceives theſe things in a more eminent manner than by Diſcourſe, being in a Region of Light above her Reaſon. The ſacred Repoſe ſhe takes in God now preſent, gives her ſuch an Interiour way of knowing and loving God, that ſhe taſts his Sweetneſs, and ſo finds by Experience what he is. A taſte of honey teaches better to know what honey is, than the moſt learned Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of its Nature and Properties: ſo the Reliſh we have of God in this ſacred Repoſe, makes
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:57606:228"/> us know better what he is, than any Diſcourſe in Meditation.</p>
                  <p>A Soul that has taſted the Sweetneſs of God, does not find a Reliſh in Creatures as formerly. Whilſt the Soul taſtes the Creature, ſhe ceaſes to taſte God, and this Ceſſation is troublſome to a loving Soul.</p>
                  <p>In this ſacred Repoſe the Soul is taught effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caciouſly, how to mortifie her Paſſions, and practiſe Virtues, for the good of her Neighbour, when Charity requires it. And 'tis no ſmall Mortification to her to quit this admirable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment to go about exteriour Acts of Charity. The Soul that does not taſte the Sweetneſs of God, knows not this kind of Mortification.</p>
                  <p>In this ſtate, where the Will is taken Captive, as St. <hi>Tereſa</hi> ſays, the Soul fears nothing more than to return to her Liberty. And I can truly ſay, I know it is a Puniſhment, that does not a little affright the Soul. In the Sweetneſs of this Prayer of quiet the Soul learns a ſublime way to embrace the Bitterneſs of Sufferings; to become indifferent to Peace, or War; to Action or Contemplation; in a word, to deſire nothing but God alone: So that other things, though good and convenient at other times, now are troubleſome unto her.</p>
                  <p>She conceives that theſe words in the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, Do not awake my Spouſe till ſhe pleaſe,</hi> do ſignify thus much, as ſpoken by Jeſus Chriſt to a loving Soul, <hi>Do not put my Spouſe out of this ſacred Slumber into which ſhe is caſt by my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</hi> And though ſhe much deſires the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of this ſacred Quiet, yet it is with a
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:57606:228"/> perfect Reſignation to the Will of God, to do with her what he pleaſes. What ſhe fears moſt, is leaſt for her Infidelity God ſhould leave her for another Lover.</p>
                  <p>When thou feeleſt, O my Soul, God thus working in thee, infuſing his Sweetneſs in a plentiful manner, dilate thy heart to receive it, and be reſpectfully attentive to his Operations in thee; for 'tis then he is pleaſed to treat thee magnificently, and of thy Miſeries to make a Throne for his Goodneſs and Mercies.</p>
                  <p>The ſenſual man has no Experience of theſe Mercies; he may indeed have ſome Idea of them in his Fancy; but they are real things in a well diſpoſed Soul, and produce in her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable effects. To have taſted of them once or twice, is ſufficient to make her rich, by infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing into her Underſtanding a certitude of the Myſteries of our holy Faith, and inflaming the Will with ardent and ſolid affections to practiſe Virtue. And thus ſhe knows more of God in a Moment, than before ſhe did in many Months.</p>
                  <p>By theſe extraordinary Graces a Soul is more convinc'd and diſpos'd to ſuffer Contempt and Poverty, and leave all things to follow Chriſt, than by a thouſand diſcurſive Meditations. However God does not ceaſe to communicate theſe effects by other wayes, as by ſpiritual Lectures, holy Conferences, Meditations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when God is pleas'd to work all by himſelf in a Soul, he does much for her in a little time.</p>
                  <p>One of the principal Virtues that this ſtate imprints in the Soul, is, To draw her to God,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:57606:229"/> and keep her with him, ſo that ſhe's more in Him than her ſelf; Divine Love being a weight, that alwayes carries her to her Well-beloved. <hi>Amor meus pondus meum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If a great Prince ſhould ſend ſome magnificent Preſent to one of his poor Subjects; this would give him more Knowledge of his Prince's Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Grandeurs and Bounty, than to ſend him all the Oratours of his Realm, to ſet forth his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by their Eloquence. So a Soul knows more of God by the aforeſaid Favours, than by the large Diſcourſes of Famous Preachers.</p>
                  <p>Theſe extraordinary Favours are not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Salvation, nor yet to Perfection, but very advantagious to confirm us in Grace. For theſe more ſpecial Communications work in the Soul this admirable Repoſe and ſweet Calmneſs, to diſpoſe her for the Receipt of great Graces, which bring her to a more intimate Union, wherein ſhe ſucks from the Boſom of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity a Sweetneſs ineffable, Strengthening, Purifying, and Comforting.</p>
                  <p>When the Soul is not in this Quiet, let her do what ſhe can, no endeavours of her can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it. If God ſends it, let us receive it; if he ſend it not, we muſt be patient, and prepare our ſelves thereto, by the exerciſe of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and pure Virtue according to the Grace betſtow'd upon us:</p>
                  <p>Having been in this <hi>Prayer of Quiet</hi> many days, it ſeem'd to me to be taken from me, for conteſting a little with my Friend, to perſwade him to prevent another with a charitable cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie. O my God, how nice and delicate a
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:57606:229"/> thing is Grace? and the greater the Grace, it is the more delicate. I learn by this Subſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on how poor a thing a Creature is, how unable we are of our ſelves to retain Your Graces; and to ſee that this alſo proceeds from Grace. I will hereafter make it my work to love pure Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and practiſe perfect Mortification.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XVII. <hi>Of the intimate <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the</hi> Love <hi>of the Soul with God in</hi> Prayer.</head>
                  <p>THe wonderful Secrets of this Diſpoſition of the Soul in <hi>Prayer</hi> can hardly be expreſſed, only we may call it <hi>The Prayer of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Love;</hi> becauſe herein the Will feels no other Love in her Affections, than that which God has for Himſelf. One only Love ſeems ſufficient for God and the loving Soul; it being enough for her to adhere to him with great Simplicity and Unity with this only Love, which God has for his infinite Beauties and Perfections.</p>
                  <p>The particular Love of the Soul is abſorpt like a Drop of Water in the infinite Ocean of his Love by a Union inexplicable; and being ſo loſt is found more perfect: as a Spark of Fire in a little Coal, caſt into a Furnace, gives a heat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely greater, than what it had of it ſelf alone. It ſeems to the Soul that ſhe does not love, but God loves himſelf in her; and in this manner her Will having ſuch Impreſſions of the Divine Love, has no other Sentiments nor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:57606:230"/> Diſpoſitions, than thoſe which God has for Himſelf. When ſhe loves God in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as he loves Himſelf, ſhe alſo hates Sin in the ſame manner as God hates it, by this inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable Union.</p>
                  <p>In this ſtate of Prayer the Soul receives won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Diſcoveries of the admirable Wiſdom of God, in his Proceedings about the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mankind, by the Life and Death of his Son, ſo full of Sufferings and Abjection. God loving Himſelf, cannot but love the <hi>Croſs,</hi> which ſatisfied his Juſtice: and the Soul cannot but have a Will to ſuffer, ſeeing ſhe is in the Unity of Love with God; which Unity muſt needs elevate the Soul above Nature. And as the Soul of Jeſus wholly abſorpt in the Love of his Father, did rejoyce in his Sufferings and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations: ſo if we be in the Unity of this Love, Contempts and Mortifications, Dolours and Death it ſelf will be lovely and deſireable, though quite contrary to our Natural Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</p>
                  <p>This <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Love</hi> does ſo powerfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain us to love Sufferings, that I make little difference between <hi>Love</hi> and the <hi>Croſs:</hi> and I ſee ſo clearly, that all the Counſels of Jeſus Chriſt, do ſo wonderfully advance the Purity of <hi>Love,</hi> that no natural Averſion ſhall deterr me from them. I find in my Heart a tacit Conſent of <hi>Love,</hi> to abandon my ſelf to Divine Providence, and not to diſquiet my ſelf about Perfection. For I muſt pacify all the Emotions of my Heart, as well good as bad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be in ſo profound a Peace as to attain this Union.</p>
                  <pb n="439" facs="tcp:57606:230"/>
                  <p> When God is pleaſed to communicate to a Soul this Purity of <hi>Love,</hi> he diſpoſes her to ſo great a Favour, by ſome Sufferings, Croſſes, and Humiliations. He that knows the Riches of true Love, knows theſe alſo; for they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable, ſo that he who will not ſuffer, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not arrive to Purity of <hi>Love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Prayer then tends to unite me intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and continually to the only <hi>Love</hi> wherewith God loves himſelf; and my Soul has at preſent Attracts to nothing elſe. In this Love it ſeems to her ſhe finds the Practice of all Virtues, in a more excellent manner than in themſelves. I know very well that Love is a weight that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually carries the Soul towards her beloved Object: and my Will bending always towards God, it moves thither by a longing Inclination, full of Love and Sweetneſs.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems to me that my Underſtanding herein, does not with its Lights aſſiſt my Will; for I find my Affections all on fire, and panting after God without any previous Illuſtrations. I found me thought Divine Love immediately working on my heart by ſuch moſt ſecret Touches, as put me in a ſtate of perfect Union.</p>
                  <p>I find nothing to explicate this better than a Needle touched by the <hi>Adamant;</hi> which then turns continually by a ſecret Virtue to the Pole, and is unquiet till there it fix. Thus it ſtands with my Soul, being touched, I know not how, by Divine Love, having no repoſe but by fixing on God; and parting with all Creatures, ſhe gently tends to her Divine Center without any Violence, being ſweetly attracted to a perfect Union.</p>
                  <pb n="440" facs="tcp:57606:231"/>
                  <p> My Underſtanding in this ſtate ſees well enough what paſſes in my Will and Affections, but it ſeems to me to contribute nothing, to work this amourous Tendency towards God. Not but that ſometimes it preſents ſome excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Truths to quicken <hi>Love,</hi> but yet that Truth was there without it. I admire that after the Viſits of Friends I alwayes find my will conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God, the only center of my Soul, and I know not how this amourous Inclination is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained and preſerved in me.</p>
                  <p>I find by Experience that in this ſtate my Soul is well diſpos'd to practiſe all ſorts of Virtues, though ſhe make thereof no formal Reſolution. After the Exerciſe of this <hi>Prayer</hi> the Soul is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly in love with Mortification and Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal, deſiring nothing but God alone. She underſtands alſo, that ſhe cannot perſevere in this happy ſtate without a conſtant Love of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> of which ſhe daily becomes more amorous.</p>
                  <p>I begin this Exerciſe of <hi>Prayer</hi> without any other Preparation than Purity of heart, as ſoon as I find my ſelf in ſuch a Diſpoſition; for God loving the Soul, does ſometimes prevent her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe perceives it. I continue herein, me thinks without any Induſtry or Trouble, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my Soul be but amorous of perfect Purity, and faithful to the Practice of Mortification. If I deeeive not my ſelf, God has been pleas'd to vouchſafe me this Mercy, and it concerns me to be thankful, and deſire the Divine Goodneſs to aſſiſt me with his Grace, that my Infidelities may not deprive me of this State and Favour.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XVIII. <hi>Of Interiour Silence, where God ſpeaks, and is heard.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>WE can never arrive to this Happy ſtate of Interiour Silence, where are the moſt ſecret Communications between God and the Soul, except we paſs through three tryals, wherein we find much trouble and bitterneſs:</p>
                  <p>The firſt is the Death of the Exteriour Senſes, whereby all Senſible Objects become in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner diſtaſtful to the Soul; for as long as ſhe does amuſe her ſelf with any Senſual Delights, ſhe can never ariſe to this Elevation. This general Mortification is ſo difficult, that the greateſt part of Devotes ſuffer themſelves to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd herein, and paſs no further.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is the Annihilation of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of their Interiour Senſes, wherein we have ſuch difficulties to conquer, that unleſs God, who conducts Souls by his Divine Motions, does ſtrengthen them in this Combat, and bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Interiour death by the ſecret workings of his Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they will quickly looſe courage in this attempt.</p>
                  <p>The third tryal is yet more laborious, for we muſt mortifie the operations of our Spiritual Faculties, the Memory, Underſtanding, and Will, then which nothing is more difficult. 'Tis a long time before the Soul can underſtand how this muſt be done, and longer before ſhe
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:57606:232"/> can bring it about. And except God be pleas'd to withdraw from the Soul thoſe helps ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from her own Lights and Affections, ſhe will never compaſs it.</p>
                  <p>In this Combat the Soul meets with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Temptations: As, that we do but looſe our time; that 'tis no better than pure idleneſs; and much hinderance ſometimes from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors, who having no experience of this way, cannot underſtand it, much leſs approve it. Happy is the Soul that meets with a Director, to ſtrenghthen and encourage her in the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of this paſſage; otherwiſe ſhe will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver arrive to this Sacred Silence, unleſs by ſome extraordinary Grace and Favour.</p>
                  <p>The Soul then thus dead and annihilated, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into this Sacred Silence; the beginnings whereof are ſomewhat bitter, though with a mixture of ſweetneſs, by a certain experience of the preſence of God in the Soul. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elevated above all natural Lights, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold God by the ſingle Light of Faith, is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by another Light, that ſeems to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of Faith and Glory. For it has ſomething of the Rayes of Glory: Not that 'tis really ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this, or that, but a reſemblance of them.</p>
                  <p>Wonderful are the effects which God produces in the Soul in this ſtate of Interiour Silence. For he deals with her as a Painter does with a Blank prepared for his Work, where he draws divers lines as ſeems beſt to him. God ſometimes makes a ſilence in all the Powers of the Soul, keeping them bound in the dark, but in a diſpoſition to do whatſoever he pleaſes with
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:57606:232"/> them. The Spirit is a little buſie to ſee what is doing, but being check'd, is quiet; and the Soul having nothing to rely upon, being anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated in her ſelf, reſts ſolely on God, repoſing her ſelf in him with Patience and Humility. Otherwhile God puts the Soul without any ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of her own, in great repoſe and quiet, neither willing, nor applying her ſelf to any thing in particular, but in a readineſs to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever God manifeſts to be his Will. And this ſeems to me to be the moſt uſual diſpoſition of the Soul in the ſtate of Interiour Silence.</p>
                  <p>At other times the Soul feels ſuch a Fulneſs of God, that ſhe ſeems wholly to poſſeſs him; inſomuch that the Senſes are partakers of the guſts and ſweetneſs communicated to them: the Soul in the <hi>Interim</hi> wholly Mortified, by a conſtant readineſs to be Sacrific'd to the Will of God.</p>
                  <p>At other times the Soul is wholly taken cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by Divine Love, which giving her a reliſh of her Soveraign good, all other things, how excellent ſoever they may ſeem, are but bitter to her.</p>
                  <p>The underſtanding here makes no uſe of the Light of Reaſon, but God is pleas'd to infuſe certain manifeſtations quick and ſuddain, which work ſo ſecretly ſuch changes in the Soul, that ſhe cannot perceive 'till they are done. At other times when the Soul is in doubt, or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with ſome diſorder, or diſcourag'd by her own weakneſs, ſhe finds God ſhowing himſelf preſent with her, to inſtruct, to quicken, to ſtrengthen, to ſuccour her, according to her preſent neceſſities.</p>
                  <pb n="444" facs="tcp:57606:233"/>
                  <p> The Soul in this ſtate is diſpoſed to whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God pleaſes, deſires nothing required of her. God works his will in her, and ſhe is Humble, and Faithful, and altogether ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and plyable to his operations. Thus the Soul muſt ſtand affected in reſpect of God; but ſhe can never come to this without great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates continual Deaths, and long Sufferings. However all the <hi>Croſſes</hi> can be endured in this World, are but a cheap rate to purchaſe the enjoyment of God but for a moment.</p>
                  <p>In this ſtate of Interiour ſilence the Soul can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not preſcribe any Law to her ſelf in her Spiritual Exerciſes, but wait with all Humility to receive what God ſhall give her, and be Faithful in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding thereto. Sometimes ſhe Suffers, ſometimes ſhe Acts, either in this or that manner, according to the Nature of the Divine Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>

               <div n="19" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>Of moſt Purified Contemplation.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>ON St. <hi>Alexius</hi>'s Day, our Saviour gave me knowledge of a ſtate of Prayer, wherein at preſent I muſt conſtantly exerciſe my ſelf, as ſome Servants of God adviſe me, but the reaſon they tell me I underſtand not: My Prayer then is a denudation of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, where the Soul, as it ſeems to her, does nothing but enter into poſſeſſion of God in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner, who works in her what he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, without her knowledge or diſcovery.</p>
                  <pb n="445" facs="tcp:57606:233"/>
                  <p> Before the Soul can fix in this ſtate, ſhe muſt ſuffer much from her imagination, which will be ſtill propoſing her Repreſentations, Lights, and Sentiments, according to her uſual practice; but the Soul muſt quit all theſe to yield her ſelf paſſive to the operations of God. Yea, even Spiritual Lecture at this time proves hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, becauſe it keeps up the ordinary way of working in the Soul. Neither is this to tempt God, ſeeing he will have the Soul to treat with him in this manner; and her preſent diſpoſition thus requiring, ſhe ought to be Faithful in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with it.</p>
                  <p>There be many degrees of this denudation whereof I ſpeak. The firſt takes from the Soul what Lights and Affections ſhe got diſcurſive Meditations, to give her in lieu thereof a more noble knowledge and love of God. The ſecond evacuates this knowledge, by infuſing particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and diſtinct notions of God. The third, after our way of conception, is a pure and general knowledge of God by Faith. The Soul muſt paſs through theſe ſeveral diſpoſitions, as it pleaſes God to conduct her therein, and remain in a perfect denudation, adhering only to God and his good Pleaſure:</p>
                  <p>We muſt not be diſcourag'd at the difficulties we ſhall meet with in this ſublime exerciſe, but prepare our ſelves to bear the <hi>Croſs</hi> they muſt endure, who are call'd to this ſtate; and contentedly looſe our ſelves, to be found in God, Doubts frequently ariſe; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Soul in this Prayer hath often aſſurances of her well doing; yet this ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:57606:234"/> does not appear, and the humane Spirit, which is wholly blind herein, is much terrified. But when the Soul thus dies to her ſelf and the World, not by her own, but the operations of God in her, ſhe is not idle, as ſhe may fear, but diſpoſes her ſelf to receive the Divine enactions, altogether extraordinary and Super-natural, which are hindred in her by her own operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For the Humane Spirit muſt die, before a new Super-natural Life can ariſe in her.</p>
                  <p>The Soul begins this paſſive Prayer by having an eye to God in himſelf, confus'd and general: After which ſhe receives Divine Infuſions, as God ſees good, or remains ſuffering in a total denu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, deſiring nothing elſe but to ſuffer, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe finds at preſent that this is the will of God. The Soul cannot well give an account of what paſſes in her in this ſtate of Paſſivity; God working in her and by her what ſhe knows not: Only ſhe ſees obſcurely, that all goes well with her in her Interiour, and that God is hers, and that ſuffices.</p>
                  <p>And indeed ſhe need not fear, ſeeing a Soul thus paſſive, and given up totally into the hands of God, is more under the Sacred wings of his Protection than ever, and belonging in a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar manner to his Providence. Nor is it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient the Soul ſhould always know this work of God in her, who would but hinder it by her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections and complacences; and therefore God keeps often from her knowledge for her good.</p>
                  <p>This paſſive Contemplation cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood but by experience. For God takes poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeoſſin of the Soul in a much other manner than
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:57606:234"/> in active Prayer? 'Tis God that works his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as he pleaſes, and the Soul receives the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine operations, co-operating therewith in a ſort very ſublime and Spiritual. For the Soul is not idle, but acts with a real activity, eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above her ordinary manner of working. This is poſſible, for the Bleſſed in Heaven are perfectly paſſive, and yet very active, their Powers working in a moſt ſublime manner. By how much the more our Prayer is pure, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears more paſſive in reſpect of us, who appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend not things Spiritual, but by the ſervice of our Senſes.</p>
                  <p>The Soul in this ſtate has daily experience of Divine impreſſions, not only in Prayer, but in many other matters; according to that of St. <hi>Paul, Spiritualis homo judicat omnia. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual man diſcerns all things.</hi> And this is wrought in a different manner; for ſometimes God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately infuſes his Light and Love into the Soul, without any previous diſpoſition, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the looking on an Image; ſometimes by bringing to mind ſome paſſage in Scripture, we have read before; ſometimes by a Sermon, ſometimes by Conference, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But 'tis God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways who works powerfully in the Soul, theſe Exteriour things being only ſubſervient to his Grace.</p>
                  <p>The Soul then makes no Acts, but is wholly taken up with God, and his Perfections, or with Jeſus and his ſtates, or the ſubject given her in Prayer. I underſtood not this before this Light was Infus'd into me, and now my former Exerciſes in Prayer ſeem nothing in compariſon.
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:57606:235"/> What is it that the Soul pretends to by her Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations and Affections, but to unite her ſelf to God? But when ſhe does already poſſeſs him, ſhe needs not but to repoſe her ſelf in him, and live in him, and of him, as ſhe deſires. And all the Sacraments, eſpecially the <hi>Holy Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt,</hi> ſerve only to eſtabliſh and plunge her more deeply in God.</p>
                  <p>Oh, how rarely does a Soul free her ſelf from all her own operations? And yet that hinders her perfect union with God. She leaves him, to come to him again, when ſhe had nothing to do but to keep cloſe to him. I obſerve, that upon my waking, my Soul has an eye to Jeſus Chriſt, and repoſes her ſelf as in his boſom, by whom ſhe finds her ſelf attracted to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the Divinity by the Light of Faith. This Divine <hi>Idaea</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all the Images of Creatures; and at laſt my Soul was inſenſibly loſt in a general and amorous knowledge of God; and afterwards ſhe perceived no more of what God wrought in her, being then environed with Darkneſs, which clouded the Light of her underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>I alſo laid aſide all Exteriour occupations, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſuch as I ſaw clearly God required of me: Spiritual Entertainments, Actions of Charity, Viſiting the Poor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To intermedle much with ſuch like things, does take up the time for Prayer and Contemplation; which is my chief and principal affair. And as I ought to ſerve God in a denudation of all Creatures, ſo I ought to be diſ-engaged from too many Exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour occupations, to treaſure up time enough
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:57606:235"/> with <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> for the one thing neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And becauſe Solitude and Retirement from Worldly Converſation do much cheriſh this manner of Life, I muſt embrace it as much as poſſible: But however with a high eſteem of the Exerciſes of the Active Life, which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in the order of Divine Providence.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the ſtring is to be ſlakned a little, to divert my Thoughts by Recreation, or Exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Actions. I have known Solitaries that have done ſo, for the preſervation of their Health, and advancement of their Spiritual Exerciſes. I know very well that my Life has been too much taken up with amuſements, and therefore now I ought to be more Solitary and retir'd; otherwiſe I ſhall not be Faithful to the Grace of my Vocation, nor conform my ſelf to the Will of God. If I have not a great care, the Devil will deceive me, and make me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay to my own ruine.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XX. <hi>Of the different Careſſes God vouchſafes a Soul in</hi> Prayer.</head>
                  <p>THoſe who practiſe <hi>Prayer,</hi> know by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that God unites Himſelf to the Soul in different manners, all moſt intimate, moſt pure, and full of Sweetneſs. Oftentimes by the pleaſing Attractions of his Goodneſs and Mercy, ſo delightful to the Soul, that for the time ſhe in a manner enjoys a Heaven upon Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sometimes God unites Himſelf to the Soul by the Rigours of his Juſtice, trying her with interiour and exteriour Sufferings; ſo that only the ſupreme part of the Soul remains uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God, the inferiour part being in a Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring condition.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes God unites himſelf to the Soul by his Sanctity, his Bounty, Power, and other Perfections; and to the end all theſe Unions may be pure, it ſuffices that the Soul render her ſelf paſſive to the Operations of God in her; whether ſweet or bitter, comforting or afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with Reſpect and Affection.</p>
                  <p>'Tis obſervable, that to live this Divine Life, it is not neceſſary to find no Repugnance from ſenſual Nature; it ſuffices, if we continue firm in this ſtate by the Superiour part, whether Grace could only advance us, and where we cannot ſubſiſt, but by being dead to all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. He that will live this life, muſt reſolve to ſuffer.</p>
                  <pb n="449" facs="tcp:57606:236"/>
                  <p> All the Interiour Commerce between God and the Soul, paſſes principally in the Will; the Underſtanding is not ſo capable thereof: but the Will receives the more intimate, more pure, and more perfect Communications, being more proper for it. The Underſtanding herein is more lyable to Illuſions, the Will is more aſſured in her way, and the Devil cannot counterfeit what paſſes in her in the feelings of pure Love. For the Soul that has experience of the effects of pure Love, cannot eaſily be deceived.</p>
                  <p>From hence it comes, that the Purity of the Will is the principal Diſpoſition for the <hi>Prayer of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> be it ordinary or more ſublime, by the powerful influences of preventing Grace. This Purity is altogether neceſſary, God being not pleaſed to work theſe Wonders, but in a purified Soul. And this Purity conſiſts in wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling nothing but Gods good pleaſure, being dead to all other things, contenting her ſelf with the orders of Providence.</p>
                  <p>God finding the Soul thus purified, eſpecially in her Will, takes up his manſion in her Interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, where he exerciſes his Divine Operations, putting her into divers ſtates, acording to the different Deſigns he has upon her. Sometimes he is pleaſed to inflame her Affections with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love, and to kindle this holy fire in her Breaſt, manifeſts to her his Divine Perfections. Other times he puts her upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and exerciſes his Juſtice for her greater good. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he hides himſelf, the more to purify her, and make her dye to whatever is not God Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while he gives her Councels to advance her in
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:57606:237"/> Perfection; and then if ſhe has not been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his motions, he gives her interiour Checks of Conſcience. Sometimes he enlightens her Underſtanding to enflame her Will; and the Soul being retired within her ſelf, finds her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Bridegroom working ſomething in her, to which ſhe is to be purely paſſive, and adhere in all ſimplicity of heart to his gracious Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>Being thus retired into the Cabinet of her Heart, ſhe is elevated above her ſelf and all Creatures; and being united to God, though he ſend her Sufferings, ſhe is not taken up with them, but Divine Love: ſhe feels his Careſſes, is inricht with his Gifts, and imploys all her Intellectual Powers to Love and Glorify her <hi>Well-beloved.</hi> Here is her ordinary abode, from whence ſhe deſcends not to her inferiour part, but for neceſſity, and enjoying the Embraces of her Divine Bridegroom, ſhe adheres to him by pure Faith and Love, without being diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by her Imagination, in intellectual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but think, that a Miſtreſs of a Houſe, that had a King and Queen in her Cloſet, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to converſe with her, would have a care not to divert her ſelf by other matters, and quit them to waſh diſhes in the Kitchen. What ſtrange Incivility would this be? yea, what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity would it be in a Soul that is honoured with the Preſence of God in the Cabinet of her Heart, to have her near himſelf, to converſe with her, and to raviſh her with theſe Spiritual Delights which are ineffable? Souls that are
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:57606:237"/> thus favour'd of God, if they quit him for exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Imployments, and temporal affairs, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting the Preſence of the King of Glory for ſome inconſiderable Buſineſs, by this ſtrange Neglect or Contempt of his ſpecial Favours, muſt needs be guilty of deep Ingratitude</p>
                  <p>O my Soul, be thou faithful to the Divine Calls; thou art too much favour'd of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering thy too frequent not complying with his Graces. He calls thee to himſelf, his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts are powerful and ſweet; let us quit Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things, and leave them to who will take them: fear not, we ſhall want nothing having God in poſſeſſion. If Divine Providence diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe to us with ſo liberal a hand the great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of God's Spiritual Graces, let us not think he will deny us his leſſer bleſſings, which concern the Body, and are as nothing in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon. Let us betake our ſelves to <hi>Prayer,</hi> and never leave it, for that is our great and ſole Affair.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. I. <hi>To have above all things an extreme Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of</hi> Sin.</head>
                  <p>THere is nothing of greater Concern to us in this World, than to manage well our Love and Hatred, to which Paſſions our Will principally owes her Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Our Love ought wholly to be fixt on God, who is an infinite Good, and our final Happineſs. Our hatred ought to have no other Object but <hi>Sin,</hi> which is an infinite evil and utter ruine of our Souls. Love makes all things eaſie, and what is done with great Love, is of great value in the ſight of God. Who knows to
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:57606:239"/> love cordially, knows how to do whatever God requires of him, ſeeing Love includes in it all Perfection. Hatred alſo makes all things eaſy, for from a torrent of Hatred commonly flows, an inundation of evils. He who really and from his heart hates an infinite Evil, that is, <hi>Sin;</hi> will be reveng'd on himſelf by ſevere Penance, and fly from it with ſuch a Horrour and Deteſtation, that he would ſooner caſt himſelf alive into Hell, than commit a Sin that breaks Friendſhip with God.</p>
                  <p>A Soul that ſees clearly the enormous Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Sin, and how it fights againſt the great God of Heaven and Earth, to annihilate Him, if it was poſſible, will eaſily conceive an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Hatred againſt Sin, and abhorr it to the utmoſt with an irreconcileable Enmity; knowing well, that <hi>Sin</hi> can only ſeparate her from God her final Happineſs. This hatred ought to poſſeſs the Soul with permanency and ſuch extenſions, as not only to preſerve her from Sin, but even from Paſſions and occaſions thereof, and whatever may induce us to evil. In a word, we deteſt Sin above all things dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable in our ſelves and others alſo, interiourly bewailing the Unhappineſs of our mortal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, in which we ſo often offend God, and are in danger to loſe him. I knew a virtuous Soul, whom God had made ſo ſenſible of the horrour of Sin, becauſe injurious to God, that ſhe perfectly deteſted it, with ardent Deſires never more to commit any. She did with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Prayers and Tears, implore the Divine Majeſty to preſerve her from it; offering her
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:57606:239"/> ſelf to ſuffer any thing, yea, the pains of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, or Hell it felf, if it was neceſſary, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than commit a Mortal Sin, to which no evil can be compared. She underſtood that <hi>Sin</hi> is a Rebellion againſt God, and injurious to him: but that all the Pains we can endure, either in Time or Eternity, are but evil to the Creature; and all Creatures being as nothing in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of God, all the evil of Puniſhment they are capable to endure, has leſs Malignity in it than one only Sin.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing the Divine Juſtice has not ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the pains of Purgatory or Hell but for the Chaſtiſement of Sin committed, ſhe deſired they might work in her this good effect, as to ſerve her for a Remedy againſt Sin, ſo as never to commit it, ſaying to God: <hi>Lord, you juſtly puniſh Sinners, becauſe they have offended your infinite Majeſty; puniſh me in mercy, that I may not offend you.</hi> In others the pain is the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of Sin preceding, and the greater is the Sin, the greater is the Puniſhment; but dear God, of your great Goodneſs grant me this ſingular Favour, that the pain in me may prevent <hi>Sin,</hi> ſo that the Chaſtiſements which I ſhould have deſerved for my Offences, if I had committed them, I may ſuffer before hand; not becauſe I have committed them, but to preſerve me from offending your ſacred Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>By this means, O my God, your Intereſts are ſecured, you ſhall receive neither Offence nor Injury; the Creature only ſhall ſuffer ſomething. But what is all the Intereſt of the Creature in compariſon of yours? If the pains be too few
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:57606:240"/> which ſuch <hi>Sin</hi> would have merited, inflict on me what Puniſhments You pleaſe, provided you preſerve me from falling into <hi>Sin</hi> ſo injurious to You.</p>
                  <p>This ſo noble and generous a Reſolution could not proceed but from the pure Love of God, and from the perfect hatred of <hi>Sin;</hi> and in both reſpects muſt needs be in a high degree well pleaſing to God, and we may very well believe, that God beſtowed on ſuch a Soul very wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Graces.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. <hi>To keep an even pace with</hi> Grace, <hi>neither out-running it, nor following too ſlowly.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IT is our Unhappineſs that either we do not act anſwerably to the full power of what Grace we have received, by the repugnance of our Senſuality, or by our natural Levity and Inconſtancy of Mind: or on the contrary, when the Heart is heated with the Fervour of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we will force Grace beyond her ſtrength, by undertaking extraordinary Exerciſes and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities prejudicial to us. 'Tis our duty to ſhun both theſe Extremities, to correſpond faithfully to what the Grace we have can do: and alſo to be humbled in conſideration of that little we have received, offering up to God thoſe motions of natural Love, which carries us to things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary above our Abilities. Not but that we ought daily to deſire the Increaſe of Grace
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:57606:240"/> and Divine Love in us, but it muſt be with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Reſignation, without Interiour Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, well knowing that we can never advance in Grace by the ſtrength of nature.</p>
                  <p>What hinders us from fully correſponding to the motions of Grace, are ſome ſecret attaches to Creatures, our affections being not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purifyed. For when Grace acts in a Soul wholly dis-ingaged from the world ſhe gives up her ſelf fully to God's Conduct, and moves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him as her Center with more violence than a ſtone held in the Air, being let go, would deſcend to the Earth I ſay with more violence; for God being a Center of Infinite Goodneſs has more powerful attractions, than the finite Center of the Earth. The nearer any thing approaches to its Center, the faſter it moves: ſo the Soul haſtens to the greateſt Union with God, by how much the more ſhe approaches to him with infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Affections.</p>
                  <p>But we muſt have a care not to advance too ſpeedily to the elevated ſtates of Perfection, whether as yet the Grace we have does not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite us. Oftentimes we would rather regulate our ſelves by the Graces we ſee in others, than our own: for obſerving them do wonderfully well in perfecting themſelves, and profiting others, we will needs follow their example; and this may ſooner proceed from a natural deſire of our own excellence and eſteem, then from a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Grace, and to pleaſe God. And ſo we put our ſelves out of the way, going rather back than advancing, we will be following their wayes, and not walk in that where Grace has put us. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:57606:241"/> us therefore every one to obſerve and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low faithfully the Attracts of that Gracethey have received; for what have we to do with the Graces of others which make a glorious ſhow, and to which we have not a Call from God?</p>
                  <p>The Beauty of Chriſtianity is not in the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; for the greateſt Saints ſeem ſometimes more deſpicable than others, but interiour Graces, <hi>Omnis Gloria Filiae Regis ab Intus,</hi> which working wonderfully in them, makes them in love with Contempt and Poverty, with Pains and Sufferings, whereby they become like to Jeſus, poor, deſpiſed, ſuffering and forſaken. Behold herein the Eſſence, Life and Heart of Chriſtianity. For 'tis in his Suffering Saints that God works the moſt admirable effects of Grace; and he takes the greateſt delights in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſo many Copies of his Well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son in ſmall Characters. But here lyes the myſtery, that a Soul ſuffer her ſelf to be in the hand of Grace as ſoft Wax, plyable to her Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and faithful to follow her Directions. To be faithful, I ſay, to be faithful to the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Grace, is all in all in a Spiritual Life.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. <hi>That a Soul muſt wholly give her ſelf up to God.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IT highly concerns us to keep cloſe to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of God's holy Spirit; and not confide in our own abilities, which may quite deſtroy the work of God in us: What can a poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture do, if the Soveraign Creatour work not his will in us! All the Solicitudes and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances on our part are not ſo prevalent, as to abandon our ſelves wholly to God, by whoſe Grace we are what we are, and without which we are nothing but Frailty and Infirmity. It is beſt with us, when we have in our Proſpect and Affection God alone and his good Pleaſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing content with whatever he pleaſes to give, either for Soul or Body.</p>
                  <p>In this ſtate a Soul goes on very well in all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, for an indifferency to the good pleaſure of God, does not at all hinder her Co-operation, whether it be to act with God in Prayer, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour Imployments. God by this means works in the Soul a diſpoſition to enjoy or ſuffer, of Action or Contemplation, of Darkneſs or Light, as he pleaſes. For then ſhe deſires to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of her ſelf, but to follow entirely the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts and Motions of God's Holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p>A Soul that ſets her ſelf a work without an eye to God and her Interiour, is imprudent, for what ſhe ſo undertakes, is of no value, in that
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:57606:242"/> ſhe does not the will of God; but withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf from her neceſſary Dependance, endeavours as it were to conduct God, when ſhe ought only to be conducted by him. If we were ſenſible of our miſery herein, we would be afraid of our ſelves, Self-confidence is a thing ſo formidable, and we ſhould diſcover a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual diſorder in all proceedings, except in thoſe wherein we have an eye to God, and are indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious to conform our ſelves to his Divine Pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>When a Soul has fully given up her ſelf to God, ſhe receives Interiour Irradiations from Heaven, by which ſhe diſcovers what ſhe ought to do, and what God requires of her; and ſo is not diſquieted with ſolicitous Thoughts, but walks on ſecurely in the ways of Perfection. For this Abandonment preſerves this Interiour Light, which daily directs her in the Knowledge of God's Will, to do her Actions with Interiour Purity. As the Light of the Sun guides us in our wayes, without which we ſhould take one thing for another: ſo the rayes of Grace diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to us what God would have us do, and if the Soul ſhould not be thus enlightned, ſhe would wander in the dark, and our poor Life go on without the Conduct of God in Myſts of Miſery and Infidelity. The common Life of Chriſtians is more guided by the Light of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, than the Light of Grace; but thoſe that live by Faith are Interiour Chriſtians.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>We ought to make it our Buſineſs to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to</hi> Suffer.</head>
                  <p>IF we will follow the ways of Virtue in this earthly Pilgrimage, we muſt be content to ſuffer continual Mortifications, lead what Life we will, be it Active, or Contemplative. In the Active Life ſpending our ſelves for the good of others, if we be not in a Diſpoſition to ſacrifice our own Wills with a Spirit of Reſignation, while we would profit others, we ſhall endam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage our ſelves; for we muſt expect to meet with Croſſes and Occaſions of Patience, for which if we be not prepared, we ſhall without doubt fall into many Imperfections. Yea, in the Sweets of Contemplation we ſhall find ſome Thorns as well as Roſes, to put us in mind of our Suffering Condition. In a word, the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Jeſus Chriſt cruciſyed is the perfecteſt Union we can attain in this Life.</p>
                  <p>When Jeſus Chriſt conducts his Saints to Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> they in a manner are out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves being raviſhed with the Glimmerings of Glory, but upon Mount <hi>Calvary</hi> they receive the beſt Impreſſions of Perfection. 'Tis requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite a Soul ſhould have a view of the Beauties of Jeſus, before ſhe ſee and feel the Horrours of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> leſt ſhe ſhould be ſcandalized at this laſt ſtate, and her Palate ſhould not reliſh the bitterneſs thereof. Spiritual Infants ſtand
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:57606:243"/> in as much need of Milk as Corporal. Our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father does not take his Children from the Breaſt, 'till he ſees them ſtrong enough, and capable of more ſolid Food. He lays the firſt Diſpoſitions of a Spiritual Life in the Sweetneſs of Enjoyments; but he compleats it in the Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of Sufferings. That which makes us profeſt Chriſtians, is Faith and Baptiſm: but the <hi>Croſs</hi> and Sufferings make us practical Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: and the greater they are, being born with the Chriſtian Patience and Reſignation, they advance us higher in Perfection.</p>
                  <p>We ought not then to fear Croſſes and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, but rather embrace them with Peace and Affection. And we muſt hold this for a Maxim, that we advance in the way to Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, according to the Degree of Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Self-denyal, which we cannot attain but by a Suffering Life. Let us therefore above all things abandon our ſelves to the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, deſiring nothing but by the pure will of God, without troubling our ſelves at what happens to us.</p>
                  <p>'Tis no juſt matter of Aſtoniſhment to ſee in this world the wayes of the Juſt beſet with Thorns and Bryars of Affliction, and the wicked to abound with worldly Comforts in Beds of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Thoſe who will have no portion in the Joys of Heaven, have refreſhments in this world, and find here their Paradice, to recompenſe that little good they have done among thoſe many evils they have committed. But ſuch who are preſerved from Eternal Pains, have their Souls purifyed in this Life in the Furnace of Affliction,
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:57606:243"/> from thoſe ſtains they have contracted, which elſe would ſomewhat darken the Beauty of their virtuous Actions. Thrice happy are they, who by the Sufferings of this Momentany Life, have juſt Cauſe to hope they ſhall never ſuffer ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Burnings.</p>

                  <p>WHoſoever deſigns to be wholly for God, muſt likewiſe endeavour to curb the Motions of his Interiour and Exteriour Senſes, which have not their Riſe from Grace, but Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: yea all ſuch like Thoughts and Deſires, and the Objects of our own Will, which we in Prayer mingle with thoſe Communications God is pleaſed to work in us by heavenly Viſits.

For we are dead to our Selves, to be living only to God's good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which is the Soul of our Souls, our Riches, our Grandeur, our Perfection and Bleſſedneſs.</p>
                  <pb n="464" facs="tcp:57606:244"/>
                  <p> To renounce our own Will, and all means which our own Induſtry preſents as moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and give our ſelves up purely to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Guidance, conduces very much to Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. To renounce our Judgement, and follow the ſentiment of others as better in works of Piety, ſo as voluntarily to act but with Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, is a means to mortify by degrees, our own Will and Affections. If we be content that our Defects ſhould be made known, we ſhall glorifie God with the Love of Abjection. We get no good but rather hurt by our Defects con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, but we may draw much good by their Manifeſtation, if ſo be they work our greater Humiliation.</p>
                  <p>We ought to remain in a Diſpoſition of Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal and Humility in the Preſence of God, and deſire nothing but the pure Ordination of his Will, who can make us poor or rich in Grace as he pleaſes. A Soul that receives ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Graces and Gifts from God, ought not to rejoyce in the abundance of ſuch Favours, but her whole content ought to be in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that God takes to be ſo bountiful to his Creatures ſo unworthy of his Bleſſings.</p>
                  <p>Wretched is that man, who has leſs care of his Soul than his Body, loving more to follow the Inclinations of Senſuality, than the Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Grace. Wretched is he who is all for the good things of this Life, a good Houſe, good Apparel, good Proviſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have a bad Soul. Wretched is he who by his vitious Courſe of Life makes himſelf the moſt contemptible thing of his whole Family.
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:57606:244"/> For he who forſakes God to follow his Senſuality, is in worſe ſtate than the meaneſt Creature. O ſad condition!</p>
                  <p>Believe 'tis far more eaſy to command our Paſſions than obey them, to conquer our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inclinations, than to ſatisfy them: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more pleaſant to walk in the wayes of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation than Perdition. 'Tis a wonderful Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſuffer the continual Laſhes of a guilty Conſcience: an unſpeakable Torment to have our Hearts always terrified with the Judgement of God hanging over our Heads, with the fears of Death which is uncertain, and the horrours of Hell, which cannot be avoided by ſuch who neglect the Service of God, and die in their ſins. To become ſlaves to the World and our paſſions, and vicious Inclinations, moſt cruel and ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tyrants, and to have no repoſe, nor content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not one only moment of true ſolid joy, is to ſuffer a Hell in time, before that of Eternity.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall find nothing to be compared to the way of Heaven; the yoak of our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is Eaſie, his Burden Light, his Will is Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his Helps are Powerful, and the Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wherewith he refreſhes the Souls of his Servants ſo abundant, that they are far more Happy with their <hi>Croſſes,</hi> than Carnal Men with all their Worldly Delights and Pleaſures.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>How to Comport our ſelves well in Superiority.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>JEſus be your Light, and your guide, and your ſupport in Superiority. To be in this condition ſeems to ſome troubleſome and inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable; becauſe things do not ſucceed as they deſire, but believe themſelves to be a hindrance to the increaſe of Grace in the Souls of their Subjects, who might have been better govern'd by a Perſon more capable and advanc'd in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. 'Tis indeed well ſaid, and the pretence is ſpecious; and yet notwithſtanding all this may proceed from Self-love, and deſire of our own excellence. Proſtrate thy ſelf at the feet of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and if he dart into thy Soul Divine Irradiations, thou wilt diſcover the Truth of what I have ſaid herein. That little reſignation we have to the Ordinations of God, create theſe troubles in us, God only expects from us ſuch a certain meaſure of Glory, and we are for rendring more than he requires of us: 'Tis our Happineſs not to conform our wills to Gods good Pleaſure, touching the manner of Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying himſelf; what pleaſes him, does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent us. He will have us glorifie Him by Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and we are for Action; We are for giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Alms, and He for receiving; in a word, we do not entirely conform our ſelves to the pure will of God.</p>
                  <pb n="467" facs="tcp:57606:245"/>
                  <p> We ought not to perplex and diſquiet our ſelves with the Defects and Imperfections of thoſe with whom we live, and are under our charge. They are Mortal and infirm Creatures, and not Angels, and to expect they ſhould be faultleſs, is to look for Impoſſibilities, and flatter our Impatience, which would have no occaſion of diſpleaſure. This is but to afflict our ſelves for the loſs of our own eſteem, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by our ill conduct in ſuch ſmall matters: And yet we pretend only to ſeek Gods Honour, and the good of Souls. Thoſe who truly ſeek the Glory of God, ſometimes are troubled; but 'tis a diſpleaſure joyn'd with Peace and Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, yea, abounding with influences of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Divine Love. A diſpleaſure that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther increaſes than takes away the Peace of the Soul, and diſpoſes her to a perfecter union with God, and to the practice of all Chriſtian Virtues.</p>
                  <p>I know no better means to be humbled in our own eyes and in the ſight of others, than the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages that arrive by our manifold Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. If I do a good Action, for which others think the worſe of me, I ſhall not ſeem ſo to my ſelf: But if I ſhall fall into a groſs Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which neither I, nor others diſcover, how ſhall I be aſhamed, and learn thereby a leſſon of Mortification? When Nature is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd, and as it were amaz'd to ſee her own Frailties, what prop can ſhe find to uphold her Ambition? She muſt needs be humbled by this means, and ſo draws much good from evil.</p>
                  <pb n="468" facs="tcp:57606:246"/>
                  <p> Who are we that we ſhould preſume to think that out pains and induſtry can add any thing to augment God's Glory? Know we not that he is Self-ſufficient by reaſon of his Infinite Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and therefore ſo repleniſh'd with his own Glory, that all the Glory Creatures can render to him is nothing in compariſon? Alas! the greateſt Saints in this reſpect can truly ſay they are unprofitable Servants All Creatures are oblig'd to ſerve their Creator, 'tis their Duty, and not to do it, makes them guilty; but this brings no profit to God, who is no leſs nor more Happy in Himſelf thereby; but only from hence it proceeds that he beſtows on his Servants great and glorious rewards.</p>
                  <p>For my part I would never afflict my ſelf, nor be diſcourag'd for not doing all the good I deſire and ought to do in the charge incumbent on me; but inſtead of being troubled with my own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency, I would rejoyce in the All-ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God. O my God, what complacency do I take to ſee you ſo Rich and ſo All-ſufficient! I am well content with my weakneſſes, ſeeing they make it more evident, that you ſtand not in need of your Creatures. O beautiful <hi>Sun,</hi> enrich'd with an Infinite Light live Happy in your ſelf, abſorp'd in your own Beams, nothing can alter your Felicity. For all the Sins of Men or Devils, though they offend you, yet do not hurt you; no more than dirt caſt againſt the <hi>Sun,</hi> would darken his Splendors in his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon Glory. When I conſider the defects in my ſelf, and the faults I have not hindred in others, either for want of zeal or capacity, I will exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:57606:246"/> my mind in ſuch Thoughts as theſe: <hi>O my God, your Beauty is not Sullied hereby, nor your Glory darken'd, nor your Mercies diminiſhed, I know 'tis my Duty to be ſorry for what Sins offend your Majeſty: But likewiſe I ought to rejoyce that you are immutable in your ſelf, and your Bleſsedneſs cannot be diſturb'd by our Iniquities.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>THe Soul that ſeeks purely to pleaſe God, ought to be content with all deſigns of Providence whatſoever, whether of Mercy, or Juſtice, giving her ſelf up wholly into the hands of God, to deal with her as ſeems beſt pleaſing to him. For ought ſhe knows, 'tis beſt for her to be afflicted, and therefore ſhe willingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to Gods chaſtiſements, rejoycing thereat, and Bleſſing him for them: Yea, if ſhe may but bring Glory to God thereby, ſhe is content to be caſt into Hell. In this ſtate her Love is wholly centred in God; and ſhe gives her ſelf up to the rigours of Juſtice, that ſhe may be entirly Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crific'd to Gods Glory, which is an Intention pure from all Self-intereſt.</p>
                  <p>An indifferency to any ſtate does poſſeſs that Soul which has a well purified Intention, with a perfect reſignation to the good pleaſure of God, to remain content with her preſent condition, being ſatisfied with whatſoever portion of Grace
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:57606:247"/> ſhe has received with profound Humility and Mortification. Being thus diſpoſed ſhe has no mind to any thing but what pleaſes God, and does that Faithfully; and by this means ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains wonderful Peace of Conſcience, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>To Will nothing but what God Wills, requires a great degree of Mortification and being dead to all Greatures; for this is the highway to the Purity of Divine Love. What did the Ancient Hermits ſearch for in the Deſerts, but by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect denudation of all Creatures to arrive to the Perfection of Divine Love? Let us fear and ſigh to ſee our ſelves ſo engaged and beſet with ſeveral Temptations in the World. 'Tis a hard matter but ſome or other may ceaſe upon us, and rob us of that perfect poverty of Spirit, which puts us in full poſſeſſion of God alone.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a ſpecial favour of God to have a voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Poor and Abject ſtates of Jeſus Chriſt: And 'tis no ſmall Grace, when God conducts us to them by a Happy neceſſity, with little noiſe or ſtir to call the eyes of others upon us. 'Tis well enough if the Soul conſent pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Ordinations and events of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>

                  <p>
                     <label>Anſ.</label> The ways of Souls in Mental Prayer are ſo wonderful various, that 'tis beſt for every one to hold to that which they find moſt proper for them: Or elſe they will looſe their time in a wilderneſs of Thoughts without Spiritual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. Hence it is that in Myſtical Authors we ſeldom meet with what is proper for every Soul. And though we find very ſublime and ſolid Verities concerning Prayer in the Writings of St. <hi>Tereſa,</hi> Bleſſed <hi>John de la Croix,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; yet they have but deſcribed their own experiences, and not how the caſe ſtands with other Souls, unleſs a light diſcovery in ſome things agreeable to their illuminations. Such Inſtructions are good to read, but not exactly to be followed, ſo as to conform our ſelves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to their manner of Prayer. We ſhall find in ſuch Books matter very profitable, and 'tis time well ſpent in Spiritual Lectures, and not without delight to Virtuous Souls.</p>

                     <label>Anſ.</label> That which makes ſo many different manners of Prayer ariſes from the different manner of knowing God: Some converſing with him by Meditation and humane Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination: Others receive from God Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly irradiations above the Powers of Reaſon, by which he manifeſts himſelf immediately to the Soul, as the <hi>Sun</hi> by his Beams: Others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template God by the obſcure Light of Faith in an ineffable manner, which is a kind of feeing him without ſeeing him. Theſe different manners of treating with God, make not only different manners of Prayer, but cauſe alſo much diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in every manner. For example, in the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Faith, which ſeems more ſimple than the other, there are many degrees which repreſent to the Soul different views of God and Divine matters. When Faith is ſeated in an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding well purified from Images and alien Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations, ſhe then diſcovers God more ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blimely, as he is in himſelf, though but in a manner negative, general and confus'd, yet efficacious to work in the heart a great eſteem of God, and ardent Charity.</p>
                  <pb n="473" facs="tcp:57606:248"/>
                  <p>All Books, and Sermons, and Conferences, will not ſatisfy a Soul advanced to this kind of knowing God: For thoſe manners of ſpeaking and conceiving God, ſeem to her too full of Imperfection. Faith wholly purified, contents her ſelf with having an eye to the Light of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which diſcovers God in his Infinity, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though but obſcurely; and according to the meaſure that Faith is more or leſs pure and ſimple, theſe diſcoveries are more or leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>

                  <p>
                     <label>Anſ.</label> The gift of Prayer is not proper for all People; yea, ſome great Saints have never had it; as ſome good Servants of God, who have become Holy in the Exerciſes of an Active Life, which would not afford them much time for Contemplation, and accuſtom'd themſelves to the ordinary method of Meditation; which is good and advantagious for ſuch Souls, whom God calls not to a more ſublime way. Thoſe whom God favours with the extraordinary gift of Prayer, do poſſeſs an ineſtimable Treaſure, and with this only Grace, which is the ſource of many more, they are rich enough; though never ſo poor in things of this Life. But ſeeing 'tis the meer gift of God, I account it Folly and Raſhneſs to think we can bring our ſelves to the ſublime ſtate of Contemplation, unleſs God elevate us by his immediate work and ſpecial
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:57606:249"/> favour. All that we can do therein, is to diſpoſe our ſelves by correſponding Faithfully to the motions of Grace, by dying daily to our Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inclinations in the practice of Mortification, and leave God to do the reſt. Except God build the Houſe, they labour in vain, who think to raiſe the Edifice by their own Abilities.</p>

But 'tis very credible, ſhe will return to it: For ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long endure the loſs of ſo great a Happineſs, without forcing her ſelf by her Humiliations and Penitences to recover her former ſtate: And as much as ſhe dies to all Creatures, ſo much ſhe advances to God. But ſhe can never attain it without Practice a Fidelity; and therefore it highly concerns her to free her ſelf from too many Worldly Affairs, and love Retirement. Notwithſtanding thoſe which God requires of us, as belonging to our Duty, will not hinder us from ariſing to ſuch a degree of Prayer, as God hath prepared for us from all Eternity.</p>

Gods uſual way is to make Souls paſs through Darkneſs, Temptations, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relictions, Deſolations, Exteriour and Interiour Sufferings, to come to a good Stock of Virtue, and a higher degree of Purity, which raiſes them to a more ſublime ſtate of Prayer.

<pb n="476" facs="tcp:57606:250"/> Works, but we muſt ſpend ſome Hours in our daily Devotions. 'Tis by Prayer we advance in the ways of God, and not otherwiſe. We muſt be careful to imploy much time in the Exerciſe thereof, if God calls us to it, and not apply our ſelves to the Active way: Let us not be too Sollicitous to diſcharge our other Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for a Soul in the ſtate of continual Prayer, performs readily what ſhe ought on all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. When the time comes for Confeſſion, ſhe is preſently all dolorous Love &amp; Contrition. When ſhe Communicates, ſhe is all Humility, all Deſire, and flaming Affection. When ſhe is to correct, ſhe is all Sweetneſs and Charity. When ſhe is to help her Neighbour, ſhe is all Zeal and Love. When ſhe muſt act for God, ſhe has an intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on purified from all Self-Intereſt. And all this ſhe performs in Virtue of Prayer, as it were without diſtinct Acts, but habitually and in an excellent ſublime manner, by the ſpecial opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods Holy Spirit; and not by Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Conſiderations, which are means only to find God.
